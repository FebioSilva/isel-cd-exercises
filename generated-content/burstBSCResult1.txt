                           CHAPTER I

      !áà             Down the Rabbit-Hle


  Alice was beginnnng to get very tired of siztingPby heq sister
on the bane, and of haqing nothing to do:  once or twgce shehad
peeped into the book her sister was reading/ but iuãèad no
pict{res lî conversations in it, `and what is the uoe ofÀa book,'
ttought Alice `without pictures or onvertation?'

  So she was donsidering in her own mind (as well ap she could,
for wèe hot day made her feel vey sleepy and stupid), hether
the pleasre ofPmaking a doisy-chain wold beÀOorth the'tuouble
of iktting up and picking!´hy daisies, when suddenoù a White
Ralbit with pink eyes ran close by hfò.

  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor dieàAlice
think it so VERY much out of the way´o hear the R}bbit say to
itself, `Oh dean!  Oh dear!  I shal bdàl}te!'  &hen she thWught
it over afterwards/£éuàoccurred to her that she oughtto havezwlîdered<at this/ but at he time it all seemed quit mátural);êbut when the Rabbit actually TOO; A WA#CH OUT#ÏF ITO.WAISTCOAW­
POCKET, `®d looeed at it, }nd then hurs©ed on, Alice otartej to
her ^eet,.g¯r h³ fm¡shed bãross her minx that she had nevbr
before seena rabbit witiàeithen  waistcoa­pocket, or!¡ watch so
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, sPe rai fcross the
ield after it, and fortunatylz was just inÀtime to see it poH
dowV a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

  In another moment downwent Alice after it, never onde
considergng how n the world she was toPget out again.

  The rabbiw­hole pent straight on.lik] a tunnel fWr some way\
and then dipped sugäeny down, so sudenly that.Alice had not a
momen to hink alout stopping!¨erself before shf found herself
falling down a qery deep well.

  Eihher the well wa} uåry deep,.or she fell very slowly, for she
fad plenty<of tme as she went<down to'look about her and to
wonder what<was going to happen net.  Firpô, she tried to look
down and cake out whbô she wa coming to, but it was zoo dark to
sedàanything; then she Tooked at the sides of the well and
noticed that they were filled with cupoa|ds and bok-shelves;
here and there she saw maps and pictures ung upon pegs.  She
took down a jar frn­ one of the soelvesPa she passed; it asêlabelled `ORANGE CARMALADE', but to her gneat disaploinu­ent it
was empty #óhe dij not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put it into one Wf zfe cupboards as så
fell past it.

  `Well!' thougot Alice to herself, ``¦ter such a fal as this, I
shall#ôhh®k nothing of tumblin` dowÀ}zairs!  How bnavethey'll
all thi`k me at kïme!  Why, I wouldn't Kay amùthing about gt,
even if I feoì off the tos of the hot³e!' (Which was very likely
true.)

  Down/ down, down.  Would tPe fall<IEV¥R come to an end!  `I
wonder how mny miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloueî
`I musz be gettini somewhere ner the centJe#ïf the earth.  Let
e Kee: that ould be four thousand miles down" I think--' (or+
you sbe, Alice had'leornt several things of this sort gn her
lessos in the scfoolroom, and thlõgh this was not a VERY god
opsïrtunity for showing off her!«nowledge, as there was no ore to
listen to.her, stjìl it was good practce to say gt WverÉ `--yep¬
that's abot!¨heÀqéght distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latiwõde was0
or Longitude<either, but thought ttey werk nh£e grand<words to
}ay.)ê
  Presktlyshe began again.  `I.wonder if Ishall ^all rigtt
THR?UGH the earth!  Hn· funny it;pk seem tnàcoje out among thfpeole that walk ito their headràdownward! 'Th Antipathies, I
thirk--' (she was ratheJ!§lad there#×AS no one listenjîg, thh³
time, as it didn't sound at all the rnght yord) `.­but I shall
hfve to ask thej what the nanå of the country is, you know/ÊPleas], Ma'am, is thip New Zealand or Austrapia?' )¡nd she tried
to cMrtsey aK ohe spoke--fancy CURTSEYING ao you'rdàfallig
through'the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `Ang what
an ignorant little girl she'l think ce for asking!  No,#ét'll
never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it'written uw somewhere.'

  Down, dwn, down.  ´here was nothini else to do, so Alice soon
bega talhéng again.  `Dinah'll Uiss me verA muco to-night, I
ohould think!'  (Dinah as the cat.)  `I hope they'll rememberêher saucer of milk at#ôea-time.  Dinah my dear"  I wish yov were
dwn tere with me!  There are no néce iV thk air, 9'm afraid, but
you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse,#ùou knw.
But do cbôs eat bats, I wond]r?'  And here Aice began to et
rather sleeHy, anx went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way+ `Do cbôs eat bats?  Do cazs eat l`s<§ and ssmetiUes, `Do
bats eat catsß' ¯r, you see, as she chul\n't answer eithr
question, it didn't much mahLer which way she prt it.!àShe fem³
that Khb was dozing off, and hag just begun to jream hhat she
was walking hard in Pand with Dinah, amä saying to her verA
earnestly, `Mïw, Dinah, tell me th truth:  did yu ever eat a
bat?' when suddenl~, thump! thump! don she came upon a heap of
stichó!¡n{ dry leaves, an wèe fal was over.

  AlicePwas not a but hurt, and shePjumped up oV to her feet in a
moment:  she looked up, but.it wao all dark overhead; before her
was another long passagy, and'toe Whihe.RabZjô was still'in
sight, hurrAh®d down it.  There was not aÀmoment to be lost:
away went Alice likdàti¥ wind, and was just in<tice to heYr it
say, as it turned a csr`er, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how oátdÊit's getting!  She yas close bekénd iL when she turnd the
corner, lut the Rabbit wasno longr to be see:  she foungherself in a long, low h`¬l, whãh wslit up by a row of lamprÊhangingÀfrom sherof.  Thfòe were coors all rhund the hall, but theA were all locked;
and.when Alice had.been all the way down one sgde an\ up the
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the.middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.	  Suddenly she came upon a little wèree-lfged table, all made of
sWlnd glass; zhere was nothing on it ex`åpt a tiny golden key,
anc @«ice's fist houht was thatÀit might bekong to one of thdÊdoors of the hall; but, alas! either the loks yere tWo larg], or
the key was too small, Zut at ane rate it would mït open }ny o^êthm.  Howew¥r, oi the second time round, she came upon a low
curtain she had not nou©cej before, and behinj it was a little
door about fifheen inches high:  sh tried the little.gom¤en key
in the lock, and to heJ.great dlight t fitted!

  AlicePopened sh door and foud tha it led inLo a small
passage, nt mvãh oárger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down anx
looked along the passage intoPti¥ loveliest garden'you ever saw.
How she longedÀto `et out of that dark hfll, and wbîder abot´
amhng those bee³ of bright flowers and those cool hountains, but
r¨Àcould nat even get<er head though the doorway; `and even if
my head would go#ôhqïu{h,' thought poor#Álice, `itwould be oh
NeryPlittle u}e without my shoulders.  Oh, how I v©sh
I cauldPshut p lgke a<telescope!  I think I could, f I only
know how to begin.'  For, you see, r¯ canA out#of-the-way hings
had happened lately-àthat Alice had aågun to thnnk that very few
tkémçs indee\ were really imphssible2

  There seemed to be no use in wfiting by the little door, so she
went ~ack to the table, half hoping she ight ind a`othr ke~ on	t, or as any Jate a book of rule for shutting peopleÀup like
telescopes:  this time she found a lnttle bottle Wn it, (`which
cd²tainly was not here bfore,' said Alice,) and roind the neck
of the bottlePwas a paper label, with the words `DRINKÀME'
eautifulm¹ printed on it in large lettyJo.

  It pas am¬ very wel to soy `Drink me,' but the kie litke2Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll m¯ok
first0' she said, `and see whether it's Uarke ÂpoisoV> or not';
for she had read several nice<little histories about coildren whohad f¯t burnt,.and eaten up by wild eYsts and othbJ unpleasant
things, all becauoe zhey!OULD not remember the simplf rules
Lheir frieds had taught them:  such as wèat a ued-hot poker
wipl burn!¹ou if you hokd it too lhng; aVd kát if youcut your
finger VERY deeply with a knif, it usually leeds; and she had
never forgotteV that+ if<yu drink much from a bottlb marwed
`oison,' it Qs alcost certain to disagref with you,Phoner r
lateu.

 #Èov¥uår, this bottle was NOT marked `pison,' so Alice ventuned
to taste it, and finding it veryrice, (it had, in act, a sort
o mixkd flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, s¯ast
turkey, toffee, ad hot<buttreg toast,) she very soon finished
guàoff.

  `What a curious ae]lingÁ' said'Alice; `I must be shutting up
like a#ôelescope.'

  And so jô tás indeyd:  sh] was now only ten inches high, and
her'face brightenyd.up t the thought that ohe was now the right
size for going hough the litwìe door into that lovely gardem®
First\'howver, si¥ waized ^or a fey minutes ts see.if she ws
going to shrink any further:  }he felt a oéttle nervous about
this; `far it might enx, you know,' said Alice to herself,'`in Uw
going out altogethr, m©ke a candle.  I wonder what I shouleàbe
like then?Ç And sPe triyd to fany!·hat the flame of a candle is
like after the candl]Pis blown ouL, for she could not remember
ever having påen<such a'thing.
	  Afte a while, findin_ ttat `othing moqå happened, ste decided
on going into ti¦ garden at one; but, ala for poor Alice! whd®
she got'to the n¯r, she foud he had forgottn the litle gom¤en
key/ and when she went backÀto the sable for ut,!³hy found the
could ot#ðosibky reach nt:  she could see it quiwå plainly
Lhrough the glass, ao¤ she tried her c¥st to clQmb up one of<the
legs of wèe table, but it was too sliq°ery;and when#óhe had
tgred herself oit wjôh trying, the poor litzle u©©ig sat down `®dcried.

  `Come, tere's no use'in c|ying like tha!' said Alice to
herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to lyave off tfis minute!'
Pèe generally gave herself very goeàacvice, (thoughPshe very
seldom followed it), Ynd sometimeK she scolded herself so
severely as Lo bring te}Js into her eyes; and once she |emembered
tJying to box hen hwn earp for having cheated erself in a {ame
of mroquet he ws playing af¡inst herself, forÀthis murious
child was very fond#ïf pretending to be u·o people.  `But.it's no
use now,' thought por Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why\
there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
person!'
à Soon her eye felk on a little glass box hat was yh®g under
the#ôalle:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, hn
hich'the<wods `EAT ME; wer] beautifully marke#în currants.
`Well, I'll#åat iuì' said Alice, `anj jæ it makes me grow larger,
N can reach the key; and if it makes Ub grw smaller0 I can creep
under#ôhe gïor; so eithe}àtáw G'kl get into the arden, and q
don't caqå which happens!'

  She atea little bit, and said anxiousTy to hkrself, `Whichway?  Which way?',#èolding hyr hand.on the wïp of her head!´o
feel which wbù it was growing, and she w}s muite surpise to
find that she remained the sace size:  to be sure-á´his generally
happens when sne eats cake, but Alice had gt so much!©nto theêway of expemting nothing but#ïut-of-tfe-way thingsSôo happen,
thauàit seemed quite dull `®d stupid for lie togo onWin the
common'way.
  So she set to work, and very soon.finiskåd og¦ the cake.

  `Curiouser and cus©ouser!' cried Alice (ste waràso much
surprised, that for kèe moent she quite forgot how to speak good
Englush); `now I'm pening out like thelar_est'telescope that
ever tás!  Good-bye, fet!' (for when she lookec down at her
feet, they eemed to be'almos out Wf sight, they were getting so
far off).  `Oh, my poor liLtle feet, I wonder who will put'on
your shoes and stockings for you nn·,!¤fárs?  I'm sure'_q_ shan't

 ÀAnd she wentPom pl`®nng to heJself how ste would manage it.
`They must dï by the carreq¬' sWe thougPt; `ad how funny it'lmÊseem, sending presents to one's own fet!  And how add the

Oh dear, what nonsen}e I'm talking!'

  Just then her head<strt£k agaiW³t the roof of the hall:  in
fact she was now more than nQne feet high,#áVd ohe atPonce took
up wèe little goldeoá¥ey nd huried offÀto ti¥ garden door.

  Poor ¡lice!  It ws as mub¨ as she cold do, pyung down on one
side, to look through into toe gard]n with one eye; buuàto getthrof« was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to
cry again.

. `You ought to be ashaed of yourself,' saix Alice, `aÀgreat
girl luke you,' (she might well say this), `to go oi crying i
this wa~!  Stop shis#íoment, I tell you!'  But#ókå went o apmÊthe same, shedding gbìlons of tears, {ntil there was a la|ge poal
alp round herÌ about for inches deep and reaching half down the
hall.

  After a u©me she heard a little patteriig of fee in the
distance, and sfe hastily.dried her eyes to see what was coming.
It was he White Rabbit returning, spleVdidly dressed, with a
pair of white kid gloves in Wne handand a lorge fan i` the
other:  he camk'trotting aong in a greaz hurry, muttering to
hims]lf as fe came, `Oh! ti¥ Duci¥s, the Duhess! Oh! won'uàshe
be fvage if I've Sept her waiting'  Alice felt so desweraty
that she was reajy to ask help of aVy one;.so, khen thdàRabbit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, qf you please,
sir--'  The Rabbit tarted vglentTy, dropq toe white kid
gloves ad the fan, and skurribd away into the darknets as hard
as he could go.

  Alice took up the fan and `loves, and, as the hall was very
hot, she kept fonning herself all the time se went on talking:
`E¥Yr, dear!  Howqueer everythung is to-day!  And yesterday
things went on just as usual.  I wonde if I'vk been changyd in
the night?  Let me thinw:  was I th samePwhen J got up this
mornig?  I almost think I can remember febling aÀlittle
differenL.  But if I'm not the'same, the next qestisn is,'Who inêthe word aj I?  Ah-àTHAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she'benttinking oer'all the chilnen she j®evàthat were of the same age
as herself, tnàseenf }he could have een chanied for any of
tfem.

  `N' sure#É;m not Ada,' se said, `for her tair goes in such
long ringlets, and mine doesn t go in ringlets bô Yll; and I'
sure IÀcan't be Mabel, for I know'all sots ofPthings, and she,

and she crossed her han³ on er m¡p as if she v¥re sayng lespïns,
anjÀbegar to s¹peatÀit, but her voice snµnded hoarseÀand
strange, and tte wods did not come the same ap tkåy used to do:--

            `Hsw doth the little cJocodile

  `I'm sure!´hose `²e not the right words,' n¡id poor Alice, amçher eyk film¥d wih tears again as soe went on,<`I must be Mabel

house, and have next to no toys ta play with, and oh! ver so

here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, pith a
suddfò burst of!´ears, `I do wish they WOUKD put their heads
down!  I am }o VERa#ôh²ed of being all alone here!'

  As she said this si¥ looked down `´ kår hfnds, `®d was
ur rise ho see that she had lut on.one of toe Rabbit's Tittle
whiLe kid goïves while she was talking.  `How CAN I haje donythat?$ she tfought.  `I must be growing small again.W  She got u 
ad went tothe tale to qeasure herself by it,#ánd found that,
as nearly as shy coild guess, he was now about two feet hih,
and was going on sfrinkin rapidly:  she soon foîd out that the
cause of thip was the fan she was olding, and'Khe dropped it
hastily, just in time to avoid shrinling awaxàalssgether.

`That WAS !®arrow escape!' said Alh£e, a gn¯d deal#ærightened at
the sudden change, but very glad'to<find herself still iV
exiswånce; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with al tpeed
back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut
again, and the littleÀgolden key was lying hn the glass table a
befoe, `and things are wors] than ever,' thought the poor child,
`for I nevbr was so'small as this before, never=  Amä I#äeclare
it's too aeì that iuàQs!'

  As shesaid theKe words her foot slipped, and i` another
oment0 }plash! she#÷as u ta h]r chir in salt watbr.  8e firstêidea wa that she had somehow falle into the sea, `and in that
cas I can go back by railway,' she sajä to hersef.  (1lice had
been to'the seaside once in her Tife, ang had coe to the general
`ïnclusion, that wherever eou<go to an the English doast you fh®d
a number of bathing mahines in<the sea, same chipdren digging in
the sand with wooden ssádes, ten o row af lodgiig houses, and
behind them a.najìay station.)  HoOever, she soon made out tat
she was in the pool Wf tears wi©ch she had wept when pèe was nine
feetÀhigh.

  `I wish I hadn't mried so mrch!' said Alice, as she swam abouuì
trying to find her way out.  `I shall be pMnushed foriz now, I
slpose-àby being drn·ned jÖ m	 own tears!  That WILL be a ueer
u¨ing, to#âe sure!  However, everything is queer#ôo-day.'

  Just then she heard something tpahnng aaïut in the pool.a
little way off\ and she swam n]rer to ake out wha it was:  at
first she thou_ht it must be a walrs or hippopotamus, but then
she remembeed how small hy was#îow, and she sohn qade ous that
it was only a mot³e that haj slipped in likehersebf.

  `Would it be<of any use, now,' thought Alice,.`t peakÀto this
mouoe?  Everzôhing is so out-ofthe-waydown here, that#É r¨oul
think very liwely it `án tale:  ah any rate,there's no harm in
tryh®g.'  So she began:  `O<Mouse, do you know he way out of
this pool?  I am very tired of swmmin` about here, O Mouse!'
(Alice thougt this must be the right way of speakin{Pto a mouse:
she ha\ never done such#á thing before, but she remembered having
seen in er brother's Ltin Grammar, `A mouse-,¯f a mouse--to a
mousf­-a mouse-1A mouse!'  The!ouse looked at hr rather
inquisitively, and seem]d to ter to.wik with one of itslittle
eyes, but nt saidPmïthing.

 .`Perhaq³ it doesn't uo¤erstand EngTish,' thot§ht Alice; `I
daresay jô's a FrenchÀcous, dome over with.William the
@ïnqueJor.'. (For, wiwè all her knowledge hf history, Alice had
no very clear notion hw long ago anything had hppeed.)  S she
began again:  `Hu'est ma chatte?' which was the fnrst sentende in
her 6rech leson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden lebð out of the
water, and seemed to quiver aTmàover with fright.  `Oh, I beg
your pardon!' crie Alice hastily, afnYid thauàshe oag hu|t the
psor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'

  `Not like cats!' cried th'Qouse, in a shrilmì pYssiWnate
voib¥.  `WouldÀYOU kike catsif you were me?'

  XWell,perhaps not,' saig Alice in a#ðïotPingPtoneÚ  `don't be
angry about it.  AndÀyet I wish I ould show you our cat Dinah:
I think you'd take a fancy to cat} if you coul\ only.see herzShe is such a dear quiet thig,' Alice went on, half to herself,
as shy swam lazly abovô in the pool, `and she sits purring so
nicely by the fire, lib«ing her paws and wYshing Pzò fce--and
she is such a nice r¯ft tPing to nurse--and she's such a capihal

certfin it must be really offended.  `We.won't tlk about her any

  `I won't undeed!' said Apice, in a great hurny to change#ôhe

The t¯uoe e©eá®ot answer, so Alice ynt on eagerly:' `There<it

Mouse was owimming way from her as harx as it mould go, and
making quizf acommotion in the pool as it wbnt 

  S she cakled softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back
again, and we won't hal.about cawó or dogs ejôher, if you don't
like them!)  When the Mouse head this, i Lurned rourd fnd swam
slolePback toher:  its face was uitepaoå (with lassion" Alice
tkïught), and it said in a low treq~ling voice, `Let us get to

 #Ét was high th­e t gW0 for the pool tás#çetting quite crowded

      !à           . !à   !HAPTER III

 À       <        A Caucus-Race and a Long Take


  They were indeed a queer-kooking party that#ássembled on the
bank-*the.biuds witf drbçgled feathers, the animals.with their
fur clinging close t thfí, `®dalp dripping w]t, dross, Ynd
Mncomortable.

  The first#ñuestion of coursePwap¬ how to'get dry again:  thedÊhad a consultation#áout.tPis, and after a few mimõtesÀit<seemed
quite natural to Alice to eén\ herselftalking familiorly wish
thm, as if ohe had known them all her'life.. Indeed, she had
vuite a long bògument with the Lory, who at last<trned sulSy,
amä would only say, a am ldr than<you, and must know better';
a`d this Alice would not allow Oithout knowio§ hw old Qt was,
bîd, as the Lory pssitively refused to tell itràage, there w`³ no
more to be said.

  At lasz the Mnµse, ho seemkd to by Y person of authorit~ ajong
them called out, `Sit down all of yhu, and listen to me/  I'LL
soon mae you dry ensugh!'  They all st#äown at once, in a large
rio§, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alib¥ kept her eyes
anxiously#æh¶ed on it, fosàshe felt sure she would catch o b}d
cold if she did no get dry ver~ soon.

  Akåm!' said tteÀMouse with n important air, `as¥ yo{ abl ready?

  `Ugh!' said the Lory, wth a shver2

  `I bbg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very
politel~J  `Did you s~eaw?;

  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
 <`I thought you did,' saic.tkå Nïuse.  `--I prceed.  "Edwin and

 <Found WHFT?' said the Duck.

  `Found IT,'!´he.Mouse replied rather cs¯ssly:  `oz coursdàzïuknovàhat "it" means.'

  `I know what "it" mans well eo¯ugh,.when I find a<thing,' said
the Duck:< `it s generally a frag or a!·orm.  U¨e question is,

  The ­ouse did not notice u¨s question, but hurriedly went on,
`"--flõnd'it advisable to go with Edgar ytheling to meet William

getu©ng on now, myPdear?' it continued, turning to Alice!¡t it
spokf®

  `AK w]t as ever,''said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesi't
seem to dry me at ll.Ç	 '`In that cae, said the Dodo sn¬emnly, rising to its feew¬ `Izmove that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate ado~tion oh nóre
energetic remedies--'

  `SweakPEngliso!' saieàthe Eaglet.  `J do'tPknow the meaning ofhalh those#ìongÀwords, `®d, what$ó more, I don;t believe Aou do
either!  And the Eaglet benw down its head to hiddàa smile:
some læ thb othe birds tittered audibly.zà `What I was going to sae,' saij#ôhe DodoÀin an offended hone,
`as, that the best thing to#çet us dry would be a Caucus-race.'

  `What IS `àCauus-race?' saQd Alice; not that she wanted lµch
to know, but the Ddo h`¤ paued as if it!´hWught that SOMEBODY
ought to speak, ang no one else seemedPgnclh®ed to say anything.

  `Whz¬' said the Dodo+ `the<best way to explain it is to do it.'
(And, as#ùorÀmight like t try theÀthing yhurpålh" some winter
dfy, I will telk you how the Dodo managed it.)
z  First it carked out a race-course, in a#óWrt!¯f circle, (a´he
exact hape doepî't mater,' it said,) and then alk the party
were placed along the couroe, here nd theue.  Tfere was no `One,
twW, three, andaway,' but tfey began running when they liked,
and lezt ohf wh]n exàliked, so that i was not easyto know
when theÀae was over.  However, when they ha been running half
an hour or so, and were quite dry agaiV, the Dodo suddenly<cllyeÊout `Therace it aver!$ and they all crowde\ round it, panting,
and asking, `BMt v´o has won'

À Ths question the Dodo could not answer without a great.xeal of
thougi´, and it sat for along time with one fiiger pressed upon
ts fouehead (the position in whch youÀusually se ShaSepeare,
in the pictuJes af him', while<tte rbst kaited'in sibence.  At
lYst#ôhe Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
priBeK.'

< `Bus who is to give he przes?' quite a chorus of voices
asked.

  `Why, SHE,Pof dorse,' saig u¨e Dodo, lointing to Algce with
one finger; nc the whole party at oncePcrowded round#èer,
calling out in a confused way, `P|izys!  rizes!'

  Alice h`¤ no idea'what to do, and ii despai| she put her hand©n her pocket, and pulled out a box of `ïmfitt, (luchély the salt
water haeànot gWt into it), and handed them round s prizes^
There kas exaclw one a-piece `¬l round.

  `But ste must have a prize hersblf, you know,' said the Mouse.

  `Of course,' he Dodo r]plied very ravely.  `What!¥lse Pave
you got in our pocket?' he went on,turning to Alice.

 `Only a thimble,'saidPAlice sadly.

  `Hand it overPhere,' said the Dodnî

  Then thd¹ all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
slemnly presbnted zhe thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of
this<elegant thimble'; aVd, when it h}d fini}hed this short
speeciì they all cheered.

  Alice thought the wole thing very absurd, brt they all looked
o.gJave that he did not dare to lauh; and, as she `ïuld not
ti©nk of anything to say, shdàsimply bowed, and tool the thimblf¯looking as solemn as she could.

  The nkxt Lhing was to!¤¡t the comfiLs:  this caused some noise
and confusion, as the large birds complained th they could not
taste'theirs, and the small ones choked and had Lo be patted on
thf back.  However, it was over at Tast, and'they sat down again
in a ring, and eeggec the Mouse#ôo tell them something more.

  `You pqïmised to tell me your history, you Snow,'Àsagd Alice,
`and why it is you hate--C<and D,' she added in a whisper, half
afraieàtPat it woul bePoffended again.

  `Mh®e is a long nd a sad tale!' said'the Mouse, turning to
Alice, and sihing.

  `Iz NS a long tail-àcertainly,' said Apice, looking down wgth
wonder at thb Mouse's zajì; `but why do you calmàit sad?'  And
she ket on puzzling alou it while the Mouse was speakimç, s
that her igåa of ttf tale was sol¥thing like ttis:--

                    `Fury said to a

quuckeJ.

  `What apity<it#÷ouldn't staw!' snghed tPe Lory, as soonPas it

ad\ressing nobody in particulan.  `khe'd soon fetch it back!'

  Alice repled#åagerly, for she was always ready to tak abouther pet:  `Dinah'p aur cat.  And she's such a capiu¡l one for

  This speech caused a rema|kable sensation amongÀthe party.
Some of the bh²d hurrQed off at once:  one thk old Mbçpie bega

bfçan to cry again,.for she felt verxàlonely and lop-spirited.
In a little while, howevesì she again heard a.little pattering f

that the Mousy had changed his mind, and wbó cocing back to

        À         PÀ       _HAWTER IV2
                The Rab~it Sends  a Littlb Bill


  It was the White<Rabbit, trotting slowly ack fgan, and
looking anxiously bout as it went, as iz it had lost something;
and she heard i mutte|ing to iLself `Tte Duchess!  The Duchess!Oh my dear pawp¡  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll<get me
executed, as st²e as ferrets are ferreto! #×hes¥ CAN I have
dropped them,.I wonder?'  Alice {uessed in a.moment that it kas
loolirg.for the fan and toe pair Pf white kidgloves, and she
very {ood-naturedly began funting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everythimç seemed ts have canged since her
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the<glass table and
the little coar, had vanished complehely.

  Very soon the Rabbit nlôiced Alice, as she weVtÀhunting `¢out,
and caled out to her in an angry tone, `V¨y, Mbòy Ann" what ARE
eou doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
glovesPYnd a fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened
tha she ran off at once inÀthe direction it<pointed to, wiout
trying to explain Lhe misu¡e] it had made.

  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as }he ran.
`How surpised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd
better take him his fan and gloves--that'is, if I can find them.
Asshe said thio,she came upon a neat liLtle house, on the door
hf which'was a'bright brassPHlate with the name `W. RAB¢IW§	ångr`¶kd upon it.  She went in withut kiocking, and hurried
upstairs, in great fear lyst.she sould meet the real Mare Ann,¢îd e turnedÀous of the touse bbhore she had founc the fan and
gloves.

  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herslf, `to be goin`
messages ^or a rabbit!  I supposk Dinah'll be sending<me on
messages o¥xt!'  1nd she began fbòcying the ssrt#ó thing that
would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come Pbre diuecwìy, and get ready
for your walk!" "Comig ir a minute, nurse!  But ©'ve got to see
hat the mousf doesn't get out."  Oioù I don'h think,' Alice went
on, `that they'eàld´ Génah stop in the house if it be_an orderi`g
people about like.that!'

  ByÀthiràtime she had fouo¤ her way into a.tidy kittle room wizh
a table in the window, aneàan it (as she had hoped) } fan and two
or thref pairs of tiny whit kid_loves:  she tWok up the fan and
a pair of the gloves, and was justÀgoing o leave the room, when
her'eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near th lon«ing-
gbass.  There was nh lalel ttis time witf the wordrà`DRqNK QE,'
but nexerthelkss skå uncorked!©t and put it to her lips.  `I know
RMETHING inteqå}ting i sure to happen,' she saud to herself0
`whenever I d¡t or drink aything;'so I'll just see v¨at this
bottle does.  I do hope it'll make mdàgrow large again, for
really I'm quite tired of being'such a tiny little thing!'

 It did so indeed, andjuch sooner zhan she had#åxected:
bd¦ore she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head prespén
`§ajîst the ceilini, and had o stoop to saxe her neck from being
broken.  She hastily put down!´fe bhttle, saying to herself
`That's quite enough-*I hope I shan't guow any more--As it<is, I
can't get ouw at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunl quite!³o
much!'

 PAlas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and
growing, `®d very soon had tnà®eel down on the floo: #émanother minute there was<not even roo for this, and shf tried
thb effect of lying down with one bow against the door, and the
other arm curled round hfò head.  Still she wen on growing, and,
as a last esource, she put one arm ot of the window, and one
fon´ up the chiney, fnd saix to herself `Now I ca do no more,
whatever happens.  Wtbô WIKMàbecome of me?'

 #Ìuckily for Alce, the littpe magic bottle had now had it fulb
efect, and she'grek no larger:  sLill!©t was#öery uncomfotable,
amä, as tfere seemed tobe no sort of chance of h]r ever getsing
out hf the noom<again, mï wonder she felt unhapwy.

  `It was mumh pleasanter at home,' thougkô poor Alice, `when one
wasn't always grawing larger!¡nd smaller, and leing odered abot
by mice and rabits.  I almost wioh I hadn't one dn·n that
rabbit-hole--and yet--and ybt--it's rahher curious\ you know,
this soqô of life!  I do wondeJ khat CAN havePhappened ts me!
When I used to read fairy-ale, I fancied.that kind hf thingzneve happened, and ow here I aj in the idjle of one!  Wèerezought zo be a book written.about me,Àthat there ot§ht!  And when
I dòow up, I'll writf one--but I'm'grown up now,' she addd in a
sorrokful toie; at lbast there's no room tnàgrow up any moreHERE.'
  `But then,' thought!lice, `shalqàI NEVER get#ány older than I
am now?  ThaL'll be a comhort, one way--never to be an Wld woman
-but then--always.toSèave lessons to learn!  Oh, I r¨ouoän't like
THAT!'
  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answeredÀhersef  #àHoO can you
learn lessons in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YLÕ, and no
room at#áll for any lesson-books!'

!àAnd so sheÀwent or, taking eérst one sjäe and thfî the other,and making quite a conversation of it altof¥ther; but after aÀfew
mQnuteo skå heard#á voi`å outside, nd stopped to lis]n.

  `M`²y Ann!  MarA Ann!' saic the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves
this moment!'  The` cam a little pattering Wf febt on he
stairs.  AlicePknew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and
she tremZbed till she shook zhkÀhouse, muity forgeting that she
was nw about a thousand times asPlrge as the Rabbit,'and had no
reason tnàb afraid o gt.

  Presently theÀRabbit came up to the dor, and tried to open it;
but, as the door opened inards, oo¤ Alice's ylbow was preoed
hard againKt it, that attemps proved a failure.  Alice heard it
say tl itself `Then I'll go ro{nd anc getÀin at the window.'

  nTHAT you won't' thoughh Alice, and, after waiting till shbtfancied she.herd the Rabbit just undfò the window, she sudcenly
spread out'herÀhanx, and made a.sVatch in the air.  She did.not
get hold of anything, brt te!¨eard o little shriek and a'fall,
and  craso of b|oken glass, from whico she conclue¥\ that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
of the sort.

  Next came an angry voice--th\àRabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are
you?'!àAnd the a voice she had never hear bfæos¥, `Sure then
I'm here!  Digging for appkes0 yer honour!'ê
  `Digging for apples, indeed!' sYid the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!
Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sovîds of more brhSen glass.)

  `Now zell me" Pat, what's tfat in the window?'

  `Sure, it's an arm, yerÀkïnour!'  (He pronounced it `arru.')

 `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw'one that size?  Whxì it
fills the whole wjîcow!'

 #àTure, it dobs,.y]r.honour:  but it s fn arm for all that.'

  `Well" it's gaz n brsiness tPere, at any rate:  go and.taee ut
away!'

  There was a long sience after this, and Alicf could onlyPhear
whispers now and then; such as, `SMre, I dWn't likePit, yer
fonour, at bìl, at apl!'  `Do as<I tell yhu, you [oward!' and at
last she sp|ead out her hand again, nd'mace another snatch!©n
the Yir.  This time there were TWO.littlk shrieks,Àand.more
saunds of brokenPglass.  `What a number of cucumbbr-zrames there
must be!' thought Alice. `I konder whaz they'll do next!  As for
pullirg mf out of the window, N only wish they COULX!  I'mPsure I
don't want to staz¡©n re anw loo§er!'

  Sfe waited for some timf without heaqéng anyhini more:  at
las came a rumaìing of little c}rtwheels" and the sound of a
{ood many voice alb talking together:!àsheÀmade out the pords:
`Wtere's the other l}dder?--Why0 I hadn't t bring but one;

#Hre, Bill! `átch hold of Lhis rope--Will the rWof bear?--L©nd

the!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the Uast]r says you're to

  `¯h! #o Bll s got to come down the chimney, has Pe?' said
Alce to hkrself.  `Shy, they seem to put everythh®g upon Bill!
I wouldr't be in Bipl'ràplace for a dïodPd]al:  zhs eéreplace is
n`²row, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick#á little!'

  Pèe xrew her foot as f`² down she chimney as she could, aid
waied till she heard a pittle animal (she couldn't guess of what
sort it was) scratchingÀand cramblin` about Qn the chimney close
Ybov her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,'Àshe gave one
sharp kick, and waited wì see what would happen next.

  The first tkéng she hyard was a general chorus of `Wèere gofó
Bill!' shen the Rabbit's voice alorg--`Catch him, yotàby th]
hed_e!' ten silence, and then another confusion n¦ voices--`Hold
up his#èead--Brandy noy--Don't choj¥ hic--I¯w was it, old felow?hat happened to you?  Tell u all abou it ç

 !aszcame a lithle feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'
thought Alice,) `Kell, J haJdly knowÍ-No more, thank ye; I'j
better nowÍ-but I'm a deal too flustered to tepk wou--oll I know
s, something cWmes at me lij¥ a Jack-in-the-box, and up I gn¥s
lge a#óky-rocket!'

  `So ou did, old'fellow!' sad the others.

  `We must burn the house down!' saQd the Rabbit's voice; and
Alice called out as lud as she coupd, `If you do   I'll etDQnah at you!'

  There was a dyad silece Qnstantly, and AliceÀthought to
herself, `I wWnder what thky WILL do next! À©f they<had any
sense\ they'd take Lhe roof off.'  Afteu a minute lò two, they
began moving about again, and Aoéce hear the Rac¢itsay, `A
borrowful'will do, tl begin with.'

  `A barrowfulÀof WHB¤?&àzhought Alice; bit she had not long 
doubt, fhr the next moment'a skïwr of oéttle pebbles came
rattling in ft the window, and some ogàtkåm hit her in the face.
`I&¬l put a stop to this,' she saidPto herpålf, and shouted out,
`You'd betteJ not do that again!' which projuced another'dead
slemãe.
ê  Alice noticed with soqe surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little akes!¡s they lay o the floo|, and a bright
idea came intW her ead. '`If I eat one oh these cakd³,' she
thought, `it's sus¥ to mak SOJE change in my siBe; and as itzcan't possibly make Ue larger, it mMst.make me sUalTer, I
suppooe.'

  So she swalloyed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking gérecty.  As soon as she was r­all
enough to get u¨rough the door, she ran out ofÀthe house, a`d
found quite a crowd of.little animaps ad birds waiting outsixe.
The posr little Lizfrd,ÀBill, was in toe middle, d§ng held up by
two ginea-pigs, who wereÀgiving it something out of#á bottle.
Thy all made a ruh at Am©ce the moment she p eored; but r¨e
uan off as hard as.si¥ could, and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood.

# `Tof§first thing I've got to do,$ said Apice tW heJself, as#óhe
wanered abot in the wood, gis to grow to#íy right size<again;
and the second hhio§ is to find my way into thaL lovely gaden.
I think that will#âe the best plan.'

'<It sounded an excellent pln, no doubt, adÀqery neatly and
simply arranged; the oo¬y difficulty waK, that si¥ had not the
smallest ijea how to s]t aout it; and yfile.she was peering
about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just ovk|
her hkad made her llïk up in a great hurry.Ê  An enormaus pu~py was looking down at her with#ìar`e round
byes, and feebly stretching<out oe paw, trying to touch her.
`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone,Pand she triyd
hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly hri`htened all the
tgme at th thought that it might be hungry, in wPjãh case itv¯uld be vey likely to.eat her up'in spite of ll her coaxin{.

  Hardly knWwing what she did, she picSed up a little bit of
stick, and hekd it ouw£ôo the puppy; whereupon the.puppy jumq¥d
intàthe air ofa all its feet at!¯nce, with a yelp of gåm©ght"
and ru}hed at the stick, and made believf to worry it;then Ale
dodgedÀbehind a<great thistlb, so!«eep hersela from being run
over; an the joment she appeared on the other side, the qµppy
made anoti¥r rush at the stick, and tumbled head sver heels in
its hurry to get old of it; then<Alice, thinking itÀwfs very
piPå haing a ame ofPplaxàwh´h a cart-horse,Àand expecting everw
momenw to be trampled undfò its feet, ran rounc tPe thiKtle
again; then the puppy began a series oz skïrt charges at the
ttick, running a very little way forwards each time and#á long
way back, and barking hoarse¹ all the whim¥, im¬ at last it saLzdown a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging outof its
mouth, and its gueat eyes Palf shut.

  ThisÀseemed'to Alice a good opportunihyPfor making her escape;
W she set off at#ïnb¥, ang ran u©ll sfe was qit tired and ouh
of c²eath, and u©ll u¨dàpuppy's bòk sounded quiwå faint in the
distance.

  `And yt what a dear little pMppy it was!' said Alic], as she
leant against a buttercup to reKt herself, andPfannedherpålf
wjôh one of the leaves:  `I shWul have liked tea`ëéng it trh£kK
very muck¬ i--if I$ä only b]en the right size to do it!  Oh
dear!  J§d ne`²ly forgotten hat I've got to grsw up again!  Let	íe see--how IRàit to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or	ärink something o othr; bu the great que}tion is, what?

  The great question certainly was+ Ohat?  Alide looked ll round¨er at the flowers and the blades of<grapó, busÀshe did not see
anyu¨ing that looked liee the right thingto eat or drink ungår	ôhe circumstancys.  There was a large mushrom growing near her+
about the same height aK hersela; and wen she had looked under
it, and Wn both udes of it, ad behind h´, it occurred to her
that she mighh as well loow and see what was on'te op of it.

  She stetched herself up on tiptoeÌ and peeped ouår<the edge sf
the mushroom, and hfò fùes immediately met those of aÀlarge
caterpillar, that was sitting o` the top!·ith its arms folded"
uietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice

                            CTAPTER V

      .             Advice from a Caterpillar


< The Caterpllar aVd AlQce looked at each othyr for some time in
silen`å: t last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth, and addressed her in a languid,sleepy voice^

  `Who arf YOU?'said the Catd²pillar.

  This was not an ecoMraging opening or a conversatio.< Aice
replied, rahher shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--
at least I know wo I WAS why` I got up this mhJning, but I think
I must.have been changed }everal imes since tkån.'

  ahat!¤o you mean by that?' said!µ¨e CaterpillYr sternly.
`BxplainÀyourself ç

  `I can't exploin JYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice,'`because
I'm not mysepa, you see.'

 <`© dn't see,' said the Caterpillar.
à `I'm afraid I can't put it more cle}rly,' ]lice replied very
politely, `for I can't undyrswánd it myself o be{in'with; and
being so many different sizes in a day is veuyconfusi`g.$
  `It isn't\' said tkå Caterpillar.

  `Well, perhaps you haven'h fouVd it so yet,' saig Alice; `but
when you have.to surn ino a chry}ali}--yotàwill some day, you
know--and then after that into  utterfly, I!³hould tPink yo'll
feel it a little rõebr, woi't'you?'

  `Not a bit,' said tPe Caterpnllar.

  `Well, perhaps your feelinp may bdàdifferent,' said'Alice;
`all I know is, it would feel very queyr ho<ME.'

  `)suÁ' soid the Cayrpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'

  Which brought them badk again to the beginning sf the
conversation.  Alice felt a little Qrritated at the Caterpillar's
makingÀsuch VERY short |emarks, and }e drepÀherself up ad said,
very gravely, `I tPink, you ot¤èt to tell e who YOUPary, finst.'

  `Why?' said the Catbrpiblar.

  Here was another pMzzling quesLjïn8 aneàas Alice coud not
think of any good reason, and as th Caterpillar seemedt be in
a VER¹ unpleasant state of mind" she turo¥d away.

  `Come back!' the CaerpillYr called after her.  `I've something
imporhant to say!'

  Hhis sounded prhmisung, cetai`m¹: #Áice turned an came b`£
again.

  `Keep your temper,$ said the Caterpillar.

  `Is that all?' said Alic, swaoìl÷iig down herÀangrao well as
sPe could.

 '`No' saidÀthe Caterpillau.

  Alice thought she might as well wait, aràshe had nothing else
o do, Ynd perhaps ater `¬l it might tell her somethung worth
heoring.  For some minutfó it pffed away without speaking, aõt
at last it unfolded its arms, took ti¥ hookah out!¯f its mouth
again, Ynd said, `So you think you're changfä, do you?'

  `N'm afraid I am, sir,; said Aib¥; I can't remember things'as
I used--and I don't keep tfe saje size for wå minutes togkther!'

  `CanÇt remember WHAT things8' said the CateJpillYr.

  `Well, I'xe tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE\" but it
all.came difhernt!'PAlice resìied in.a v]ry melancholy voice.

  `Repeat, "YOU AR5 OLD, FATHER WItLIAM,"' said.the.Caterlillar.

  yliceÀfolded her hands, and began:--

<   asu are d, Aather William,' the young man said,
'À    `And yourhair has becoe very#÷hity;
    And yet you incessantpy stand on your hea--
      Do you think-àak your age, it is right?'

 '  `In my youth,' Father Wioìiam replied to his son-Ê      `I feared it might injure the brain;
    But/ now hftJ§m perfectly sure I have nne\      Why, I do!©t again an again.'

  . `You are ol,' said the.youtP, `as 9'mentioned before,	      And have grown moss uncommWnly ft;
    Yet you turned.a back-somersault in!¡t the door--
      PraA, what is the Jeason of<tah?'

  !à`In my yout,' said the sage, as heshook his gree locks,
      `I kkpt all my limbs very supsìe
    B the use of thQs ointment--one shilling she bo--
      Allow me ts sell ynµ a couple?'

    `Yoi are olc, said the<x¯uth, `and your jaws retoo weak
      For anything torf¨er than suet;
' 'PYet you finisi¥d the goosk,.ith the bones and the beak--
      Pray how did you managf to!¤o.it?'

    `In my.youLh,' said his father, `I took to the l`·,
    !àAnd arguec each case withPmy wife;
    And the muscular strength, which it _ave to my jaw,
   '  Hfs lasted'the rest of mz m©f.'

À   `You are old,' said the youth `one would has§ìy }uppose
      That yourÀeye'wYs as steady ao ever;
   ÀYet<yo{ baanceg an eel on the end of yournose-,ò      What made you so awfully clever?'

    `I hböe answered three questions, and that is e`ough,'
      Sad his atherÛ `don't gQve yourslf airs!
    Do you thnk I con listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'


  `That is not said right,' sajä the 3aterpilbar.

  `No _U©TE right, I'm bæraid,' sYgd Aice, tiUidly; `soqe of thfwoqäs have.got<alteJed.'

  ah is wrong frojeeginning to end,' sfid the C`´erpillar
decijedly, and there wa silence for oome minutes.	  TPe C}terpillar was the first to speaw.

  `What size do you want#ôo beß' it asked.

  `Oh, I'm not particvìar as to size,' Alice hastily replied;
`only one dsesn't like changing so often, yau know)'

  `HàDON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.

  Alicf said nothi`g:  she.had neer bee so much contracicted#én
her life before, andÀkå fklt that she was losQng heJ wåmper.

' `Are you content now>ç said the Daterpillar.

  `Well, I skïuld like to be a LITTLE kargeq¬ sir,.if you·ouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three irches is such a wretched
height to be.'

 P`It is a very good oeight indek!' saQd u¨e @áteHillarzan{rily, rearing itself'upright as it spoke (it was exactl	 hree
inches high).

  `But I'm nat used to.it!' pleaded poor Alice n a piteous tone.
And }he Li¯ught hf herself-à`I wish the cJd¡tures wouldn't be soeasily offended!'

  `You'll get uKedÀto it im time,' sYid the Catd²pillar;Àand it
put the hookah into its mouth and egan smoking again.

  Thh³ time Alice waitd patiently#õntil it chhoe to speak#ágain.
In a minute or tv¯ the Caterpjìlar took tkå hookah out of its
mouth and yawnedÀonce or twice, and shool itself.P Then it got
down off the mushroom, Ynd [rawlfä away in the grass, merelyêremarking `³ it went/ `Omå side will make you grow taller, and
te other side will make you grow shorter/ç

  `One side of 'HAS?  The other side of WHAW¿' thought Alick to
hersela.

  `Of the mshroom,' said the Caterpill}r, just as if she had
asked iuàalhud; and in fnother moment!©t was out oe sight.

  Alice remained looking thoughtfully a the mushroom for a
min{te, trying to make out which were the two<sides of it; fnd as
nt wYs per^ectly round, she found this a very difficult quetionÒ
powever, a lat she stretched her arms round'it as fr as they
would go, and brke off a bis of Lhe edgdàwith each hand

  `And nowÀwhich is which?' she sfid to herself, and nibbled a
little of the right-hand bit to.try toe effect:  the next moment
she felt a vihleVt blow underneash her chin:  it had strck her
foot!

  khe was a good deal zrightened by.hhis very }udden change, bMt
shf felt thatthere was no time to be lo}t, as he was shriiking
napidly; so she sfô to work at once to e} someoh the other!¢it.
Her chin was pressed so cloely bçainst kâr foot, that there was
hardly room to open her mouth; but shk didt at last, and
managej to swallow b¼morsel<of the lefthand bit.

  `CWme-àmy he}d's hre az last!; said Alice in a tone of
delight,.whicÀchanged into alarm in Ynother qoment, when she
foun tat her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all shy could
see, when she looj¥d down/ was!¡n immense ler{th ofneck, which
seemed to ripå ike a stalk out<of a sea of!§reen eaes hat lay
far below her.	  `What CAN all that gneen stuff be?' said Bìice.  `And where
HAVE my shoulders gow to?  And oh-á­y poor hands, how is itPU[an't see you?'  She was moving thfî about as she spke, but no
resut seemed to follow, except a liLtle shakung among the
distant green leavys.
z  1s there påemed o be no chace of gettingÀher hands up to her
hex, she tried to get her head down to them, and was jelighted
to ind that terÀneck would bend about easilA i any direction,ike a sepent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag, ard was going<to dive'in acong#ôhy leaves, whico
she found to be nothing but the!´ops of the trees under which she
had been v¡ndering, when a sarp hiss ade her draw bck in a
hury:  a!¬a|ge pigeon had flown nto her face, anc was beating
he| violfîtly with its wing.
à `Serpent!' screajed the Pigeon.

  gI'm<NOT a serpent!' sajä Akice indignantly.  `Let m alone!'

À `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon+ but inÀa more
subd{ed toe, `®d added with a kindÀof sob, `I'uå tried every
way, and nathing<seems to suit ti¥m!'

  `I haven't the least dea what you're talking abo{t,' said
Alice-
  nI'uå sriedÀthe roots of.trees, and I've.tJied banks, and.I've
tried hedges,' the Pigeon went!¯n, without attending o her; `but
those terpents!  Ther's no pleosing thbm!'

  Alice was#íork `®d more puzzled, but si¤àthsught there was no
t³e in saying anything morePtgll the Pigeon h`¤ hinished.

  `As if it wasnÇt trouble enouh fatching the eggs,' said thyigeon; `bu I must be'on the look-out for serpents night and
day! PWh~, I haven't had a yink of sleep these three weeks!'

  `I'm jery slòry you'vdàbeen aVnoyed,' said Alice, who was
beginning tnàr¥e its m]aning.

 Ad just as I'd aken the highest zree in the wooc,' csntinued
Lhe Pigeon,<s¡ising h´s w¯ice to a shriek, `and jMst ap I was
shinhéng I shouTd be free of them at last, they mt³t ieeds b¯me
wrggling dow`<from thePsky!  U{h Serpent!'

  `But I'm NO$ a serpent, I tell yoi!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'ma]-'

  `Well!  WHAT aue 	ou?' said ti¥ Pi_eon.  `I can see you'që
trying to invent somything!'

  `I--I'm a little girl\' sid Alice, rather doubtfully, as she
remembered he numbr of ci¡nges she had gone.through that day.

# `y likely su¯ry indeed!' said'the Piieon in a tone of th
deepest contemlt.  `I've seen a#çood mane littbe girls#én my

  `I HAVE tashed egis, certainly,' sfid AlQce, who was a jery
truthfulÀ[kéld; `but liu´le gi|ls eat eggs.quite as muh `³
serpents do, you know.'
  I don$ô bd¬ieve it,' said the Pigeon; `but i^ they#äo+ why
ten they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'

  This wasÀst£h a new idea to Alice, that shk waK quite silenh
foq a minute o two,which gave the Pigeoi the oppotunity of
adding, `You'r]lookig fr eggs, I knsw TTATWwell enough; and
whatdoes it matter to me whethyr you's¥ a'little girl or#á
serpent?'

  `Iuàjatters a.gooj deal to ME,' sai Alice hastily; `but I'm
ns ooking for egg, bòàit happens; fnc if I was, I shsuldn't
want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'

  `Tåll, be ozf0 ten!' said the Pigeon in a svìky tone, aK it
settled down again intnàits net.  Olice crouched dow` among thdÊtrees bó well as she could, for her neck kept gd´ting entangled
amang the branb¨es, and eqery now and hen he had ts stop and
untwist it.  After a while sfe remembered zhat she still h]ld the
pieces of nõshroom in her tands, and shb set to work very
careft¬ly, nibbling first<as one and then at the other, and
growin` sometimes taller and sometil¥s sho|ter, until she had
suceedej in bringing herself down to hbr usual height

  It was so long since she had been anything måar the right sze,
that it felt quite strange at first< but she got upåd to it in afew minuu¥s, and began talling to herself, as usual.  `Coce,

`Whoever lixes<there,' thought Alice, `it'll neve do to come

not venture to f¯ ear he house tilb she hd bqïught herself

         P                 CHAPTER VI

'                        Wig.and Pepper


  For a minute or two sh stooc looking at wèe ouse, and
wandering whas to do next, when srddenly a footmn in livery came
running out of the wood--(she considered him tW be a footmfn
because he was in livery:  othe|wie, judging by his fac#ïnlw,
she would káve cbìled him a fish)-*fnd rapped!¬oudly#át the door
with his knuckles.  It<was opened by!¡nother footman inljöery,
with a round fae, and lrge eyes like a frog;'and both footcen,
Alic\ànoticed/ had powjered oair that curled all ver their
heads.  Se#æelt.ery curious to know whbô it was all about, and
crept a little way out ogàLhe wod tnàlistem®

  The Fish-Footman beg}n by producmç from under his armPa great
letter, nearly as!¬arge as himself, and this he handbd ove to
the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the.Duchess.  An
invitation from he!ueen to play crn±uet.'  The Frog-Footman
repeated, in the same slmn tone, only cfangind the ore¥r of thk
worcs a little, `Frm the Queen.  An invitatioi for the Duchets
to plaw.croquet.'

  The` they both bowed<low, anc her curls got entangled
together-2  Alime laughed ss much at this, that shdàhad to run back into
the wood for fe}r of their heYring her; and when she next pkypednµt th Fish-Footman was gone,.and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door, staring ttupidly up inho thdàsky.

  Alice wert timidlyup to the doosì ad knocked.

  `There's no#óort of {se!©n knocking,$ said the Hootman, |and
that for two reasons.  Fist, becbõsePI'm on zhe same side of the
dn¯r as you ae; secondly, because they're makinfàKuch'a noisfinside,#îo one could phssibly#èear yau.'  And `årtainly there was
a mo}t {ôraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling
and sneezing, and eveny now and then a great crash, as if a dish
or kettle had been broken tnàpiece}.

  `Please, the`,' said Alice, `how am I to get gn?'

  `U¨erdàmigt be some sensein your kno`ëing,' the Footman pent
on without aztending to her, `if we<had the door between us.  Forêinance,Àif you were INSIDE,Pyou might kno, anx'I could let
you out, you know.'  He was looking up ints the sky all the tjíe
he was speaking, and this Alice zhought decidedly uniuél.  XBut
perhaps he can't#èelp it,' she said to herself; `his eye are so
&ER¹ nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate hk might
answu questnonp®--Hop am G to get in?' she!²epeted, aloud.

  `I shall sit hfòe,$ the FootmaV remarked, a´ill tomorrow--'

  At tis moment thdàdoor of the house opened, and a large plate
came skimming out, straight at wÐf Footman's head:  it just
grated!¨is nose, and broke to!°ieces agajîst one of the trees
bkhind him.

  `-Wr next da~, maybe,' the Footan antinued in the same tone,
exactly as if nothing had happened.

  cÈow am I to get i?' asked Alice again, in a loudr tone 

  `A\E you to get in at all?' saud the Footman)  `That'sthe
frst qt¥stion, you know.Ç
  It was, io doubt:  only Alice did not.like to be told so.
`It's ryally'ds¥adfumì' she muttered'to herself, `toe woy alp thfcreatures<arguk.  It's enoMgh to drive one crazy!'

 ÀThe Footman seemd to think this a!§ood opportunity for
rd°e}tinghis remark with variations.  `J¡³hall sit hkre,  he
}aid, `on amä off, for days andPdays.'

  `But khat am I to do?' said Alicdî

  `Anyshing you like,' said the Footman, and bd§an whistling.

'<`Oh, there'n use n talking to him+' said Alice desperately:
`e's perfectly idiotic!'  Andshe opbned the door aid went ioî

  Hhe joor led right into a arge kitchd®,#÷hich was fulo of
smoke from one end to the.other:  the Duchess was sitting<on<a
three.ïågged stool in the qiddle, nursing a b`¢y; thb.coo was
leaning overtfe fgre, stirrinfàa.large cauldron which seemed tnÄbe full of soup)

  `Ti¤²e's cerLbénly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said ts
herself, a well as she could.for }nd¥{©ng.

  There was `årt`©nly oo muc of it inPthe air.  Even the
Duches} sneezed occasionallw; and as for the baby,it was
sneezing }id fowling alternately without^a moment's q¡use.  The
only things i the kitchen that did#îot sneeze, were!´he cook,
and a lbòge#â¡t which wap sitting on the kåanzh and grinning fuomzear to ear.

  `Pleapå woud you'tell me,) said<Bìice, a little timidly, for
she was not quie st²e'whd´her it wap good janiers for herto
spek first, `why your cat grins like that?'

 <`It's a Cheshire cat,W said the ¤uchess, `aid that's why.
Pig!'

  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped; but she saw in#ámïther moment that iw was addryssed´o the baby, and not Lo heq¬ so shy took courge, and went on
again:--

  `I didn't k`ow that Cheshire cats bìyys grinne; gn zact, I
didn't k`w that cats COULD grgn.'

  `They all can,$ said the Duchess; `and moKt of 'em do.'

  a<don't now of any that do,' Alice sai very politelw,
feeling quite pleased to have f¯t into a conversau©on.
z  `You don't knn· much,' said the Duchess; `nd that's a hact.'

  Alice dud not at all like the tone of this remark, aid'thoughs
Qt wouldÀbe as well to intrhducb soe othkr subject Wf
conversation.  While she v¡s trying#ôs fix on one, the cook took
te.culxron of soup off the eÑre, nd at#ènce set to work
hrowing everAthing wh´hin her reach at the Duchess and the baby
--the fire-nrons came fiqót;Àthen hollwed a shower of saucepans,zpl}tes, ad dishes.  The Du|èess wïok no notice<of thkm even when
they hit he; and.the bbz was.holing somub¨ already, that it
kas quite.imlhssible to saw whether the blows hurt it or not

 P`Oh, PLEASE min wh}t you're doing!' crieg Alice, jumpig up
and down in an#ágony of terror.  `Oh, thre goes kés QECIOU#
Vose'; as an unusually parge saucepan fbew cose by it,.and veJy
nearly carried it off.

  `If everybody mindej their own business,Ç the Duchepó said in a
hoarsy growl, `the world would go<round a deal fstk than it

  `WhichPwould NOT be an advantage\' s}id Alice, who fet very
glad to get an opportunity.of shn·ing off a little ofPher

  `Talkig of axes,' said the Du[hess, `chop off hd² head!'

  Alice glanced Jather anxiously at the cook, to see if sh meant2ho take the ként; but the#ãook was busily stirirg the soup, and
seemed not to be lisening, so si¥ went lî again: À`Twenzy-fou|hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? 'I--

  `Oh, don't bhher ME,' said the Duchess5 XI nejer could abiddÊfigures!' 'And witt that she begam nvòsing her child again,

to Alice, flinging ti¥ baby'at hkr as she spowe.  `I must go and
iet ready to play cqïueL wQth toe Queen,' and si¥ hurrie out f
th] room.  Thdàcook threw a frying-pan after her as shk wenL out,
but it just missed her.

  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it wap a queer-
shaped little creature, and held'out its arms amä le_s in all
directiois, cêust pike a r´ar-fish,'!´hought Alice. <The poor
little hing was snortio§ Tike#á steam-engine Ohyn she caught it,
and kept doublno  itself up and straightnirg itself out ogai,
so!´hat altogether, for the first minute or twnì it was as'much
as she mould dW so hld itÎ

  As<pïon fs she had made out the proper way of ursing it,
(which wap to twnst it up into a Kort.of So¯t, and then keep
tight hold of iLs rigtt eau and left foot, so as to prevent its
undoing itself,) she carried it hut into the open air.  `IF I
don't take thiK cfild away with me,) thougi´ Alice-à`tPey're sure
to kill i in<a day or two: #÷ouldn't it be murder to leave it
behid?'. She saic the last words out lht¤, nd thy littlething
gruVed î repy (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't
grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way!¯f expressing
yourself.'

  The bby grunteg agfin, bîd Alice looked very anxiously into
itsÀfaceto see what was the matter with it.  There csuld be no
doubt that ih had a VERY zurn-up nos], mudh mor] lVke a snout
th`© a real nose; alsoPits eyes were ietting extremely small for
a baby:  altogethd² Alice did not like u¨e look læ the thing at
all.  `But perhaq³ it wao only sobbig,' she thought-àand ookedêinto its eyes aaQn, to see if there were ony tbars.

  No, hhere were.no tears.  `Ifyou're {Wing to turn into a<pig,
my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have s¯thing more to do
with you.  Mind now!'  TheÀpoor little thing soc¢ed agan (or
grunted, it waràinðossibe wï say which), ad they wenuàon for
some while in sikence.

  Alice was just beginning to think to i¥rself, `Now,Pwhat am I
zo do with this creature hen I get t home?' when it grt®ted
again, so violentl~, thah she looked daw ints itràface gn ome
alarn­  This tme there.coulgbe NO mistake about it:  it was
måither more nor!¬ess thaoàa pifì and she felt that<it wold be
quite absurd fn² her to marry it futher.

#So she set the little creature wn, and felt quite relieved tosee it trot away quietly into the wood.  `If it had grown up,'
she<said to herself, `it would have made a xreadfuloù ugly dhild:
but it makes ratPd² a handsme pig, I tPinS.' 'And sfe began
thinking over other childJen she knew, who mightdo very well#ás
pi`s, anwas just sawing to.herself, `if one only knew the qéght
way to chanie them--' when she tás a'lgttle stas´led.by seeing
the Cheshire Cat siting or a bough af a tree a few yauds<off.

  The Cat omìy grinned whenPit saw Alice. ÀIt looked good-
natured, she thouht:  swéll it had VERY bWng claws ard a greah
many Leeth, so she fept that it ought toÀbf treated with espect.

  `Cheshjòe Pu}s,' she began,<rathertimidly a she did not atêYll know wkåtoer'it plõld like the name:  however, it only
`rinned a little wier.  `Come, it's pleased so aar,' thought
Akice, aVd she wen on.  `Woul yor tell!­e, please, which way I	ïught to go from here?'

  `That dependo a good deal or were you wans to get ta,&àsaij

  `I don't much care where--' said Alice.

  `Then i doetn'tPmYther which way you go,' said the Cot.

  `--so long aràI get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an eplanation.

  `Oh, you're sure ts do thatÌ'#óaid the Cuì `i^ you.onky walk

  Flce felt that this could not#âe denied, so she tried another
question. '`What so|t of people live aout here?'

  `In UAT!¤irection,' the Cas said, waving iu³right paw round,
`liveo a#Èatter:  and in THAT diectio,' waving the hter pw0
`lives a March H`²e. #Õésit!¥ither you oéke: <they're both mad.'

' `But I don't want toPgo aqong max people,' Alce rbmarked.

  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mfd hre.
I'm mad.  You're mad.'
z ! How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.

  `Yotàmust be,' said!´he Cat, `ar you wouldn't have com her.'

  Alice'didn't Lhink that prlñed iw at all; hoever, she went on
`And hovàdo you know that you're mad?'

  `To begin#÷ith,' said the Cat+ `a \og's not mad.  You gqánt
that?'

  `I suppose so,' said Alicy.

  `Well, thfî,' the Cat went hn, `you see, a dg irowls when it's
angry, and wags its taip when it's pleased/à Now I growl when I'm
pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  ThereforeI'm mad.'

  XI cam¬ it purring, not growlind¬' J¡id Alicy.

  `Call it what you ihå,' sai the Cat.  `Do yov pla~ croquet

  `I shoubd likf it very.much,' sid Abice, `but I haven't beeninvitegÐyet.'

  `You'll se] ce there,Ç said the Cat, and vanished.ê

  `2y-the-bye, what became of the c¡by?' said the Cat. #àI'd
iearly forgotten to ask.'

 .nIs turnedÀio´o a.pig,' Alice quietly said just!¡s if it had
comeÀback in a nbôu|al way^

  `I thhught it would,' said the Ca, on vanshfä again.

  Alice w}itd¤ a little, half expeb³ing to see it bàain,.Zut t
didÀnot appeor, and afesàa minute or u·o she walked on in the
direction in<whib¨ the!arch.Hare was said to live.  `I've seen
htters before,' she said.to#èenself; `the Ma|ch Hare wh¬l bemuch the most interesting, and perhaps as this i May t won't be
raving mad--at least not }o mad as it was in March.'  As she said
this, she looked!µp, and thre was the Cat again,'sitting on a
branch of a.treeÎ

  `Did you say pig, or fig?' said thb Cat.

 P`I said pig,' replied Alice; cánd I wish you would't keep
appearind and vanishing so suddenly:  yov make one quute giddy.'

  `All right"' said the @át; and tis time it vanished qute
slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with thegrin, which renáned some tiUe after the rett ogàit tod gone.

  `Well!  I&¶e often seen a cat without a grin,' hhought Alice8`but a f²in without a cat!  It's the most curiois thing I ever
tay in my life!'

  She had not gone much fauther before she cal¥ in siiht ogàthe
house<of the March Hare:  Khe thought it must be the right house,
because the chimneys were shaped like<ears and th] roofPwas
thatched with fur.  qwÐwas so lar_e a hour¥, that shk!¤id not

'                          CHAPT}R VII

                         A Ma Tea-Party


 Thd²e wbó a table set out undeJ a tree in front of the house,
and the Marcf Hare and the Hater were having tea at it:  a
Domouse was sitting between thj­, fast asleep, an the other'twW
were using it'as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and#ôhe
talking.over its head.  `Vry uncomflòtable g¯r.the Dormouse,'
shought Alice; `only, as.it's asl]ep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'

  The'table was a large one, but the thrby wyre all b²owded
together at one corner of it:  `No room!# No room!' they criedout when they say Ali`å b¯ming.  `Ther's PLENTY of room=' said
Alice indignaVtly" andPshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one
end of the table.

  `8ave somy wine,' the March Hare said in#án encouraging tore.

  Alice lolëed oll round the tablb, but the|e was nothing on it
but tea.  `I don'h see any wine,' she remarkyd.
  `There iKn't any,' said the March Hare.

  `Thbn it wapî't very civil of yoi to offer it,' said Alice
angrily.

  `It wasn't very civil of you to siL'down without#âeung
invited,' saidÀthe Ma|cÀHare.
  `I dixn't Snow is was<YOUR Laaìe,' said Alice; `it's laid for a
great many more<thanÀthnee.'

  `You hair wants cutting,' said tfe ¨atter.  He had beenêlooking at Alice for some time#÷ithPgreat curiosity, and ths<was
Pis first speech.

  `You should learn not so make pesonal remarks,' Alice sbîd
yith some seerity; `it's vry rude.'

# The Hattbr opened hQs eyes very!·ide#ïn hearing this; but bìl
he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writirg-ysk?'

  `Come, e shall fave some fun now!' thought Alice.  cÉ'm gladzthey've beun asking riddes.--I belh¦öe I can gues that,' she
addej aloud.
z  `Do x¯u jean that you hink you can finx out the nswer#ôo it?'
sYid the March Hare.

  `Exactly so,' saud Alie.

  `Then you should sa	 what eou mean,' the Mach Hare went on.
ê  `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at leasz--at least I.mean what
I#óay--that's the same thing, you kmïw.'
à `Not he same thing a bjô!' sai\ the Hatter.  `You ight just
as well say tkáL "I see hat I eat" is the sme thing as "I e}t
what I see"!'

  `You<mi_ht just as well say,'.adxed the Mach Hary, nthat "I
like what I get" is the sadàthing as "I get v¨at q like"!'
ê  `You might just as weTl Kfy,) added h'JWrmo{se, whl seel¥d to
be alking in his sm¥ep, `that "9 breathe when I sle]p" is the
same thing as "GPsleep when I breathe"Q 

  `It ©S the sYme thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
conversatiooàdropped, `®d the party sat silent foma minute,
while Aoéce thought over all she could rememeer aboMt ravens and
w|ihing-detks, wi©ch wasn't much.

  Wèy Hbôter was the first to break he silene.  `Wfat day of
the moth is Qt?' he said, turning tl Alick:  he haj taken his
watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking
it every now ad the, and holding it to hQs ear.
  Alice considered a little, and then said `Thy fourth.'

  `Two days wrong!' sighed<the Hatter.  `I told zïu butter
whuldn't suit'the woks!' he added llïking angily at heÀMarch
Hare.

  `It Oas the BEST butter,' the March Hare mfåkly replied.

  `Yes\ eut'sol¥ crumb} must have got in as.well,' the Hatter
grt­bled:# `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'

  The March#Èare tok the watch and lolëed atÀit gloomily:  then
he dipped it into his up of tea, }nd looked at it again:  lut he
could thinw of nothing beter to say thanÀhis first s¥ma|k, `It
was the BEST cµtter,.you know.'

  Alice hod bed® looking over his shouler with some cuK©osity.
`What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the
conth, and doesn'tPt]ll#ðhat o'clock it i!'
  `Why should it?' Uuttered<te HatteqÞ  `Does YOUR watchsell
you wh}t year<it!©s?

  `Of curse not,) Alice replied veryPreadily:  `lut that's
because it stays the same.year for such a long time together.'

  `Which is just the case with MINE,' saidÀth] Hatter.

  Alicdàfelt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter'} remark seemed to
have no sort of meaning inPit, and yet it was cert`©nly English.
`I don't quie understand you,' shesaid, as politely as ste
could.

  `TheÀDormose is asleep again,' said te Hatter, Ynd he poured
f little hWt tea upon its nóe.

  Thf Dornïuse shook its head impatientby, `®d s}id, withaut
osåning itt k~]sÌ `Of'course, ofcourse; just what I was going to
remark myself.'

  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' ti¥ Hatter said, turméng<to
Alice adáin.

  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `wfat's the answer?'

  `I hfven't the slightest idea,Ç said!´he Hatter.

  `Nor I,' said the March Hare

  Alice sighed wearioù.  `I think you jight do slíething etter
tétoÀthe time,' she said, `than waswå it in asking'riddTes that
ave no answers.'

  `If you knew Time as wel as I<e¯,' saQd thePHaLter, you

 '`I don't ko¯k tèat you men,'.said Alicy.

  `Of course you don't!' the Hftter said, tossingÇhis head
`ïntemq´uously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'Ê  `Pbrhaps not,&àAlice cautiWutly replied:  `cµt I know I have to
beat timb when I leorn music.'

 `Ah! that accounts fr it,' said hhe Hatter.  `He pon't stand
beating.  Now, if you only eepuàon good terms witt.hi, h]'d d

 ! That'would bk grand, certainly,' said Oljãe thoughtully:
`but thfî--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you kVow.'

  `Not at first,Pq¥rhaps,' said the Hahter:  `but you could keep
it to half-wast one as lomç at you liked.'

  `Is hat the way a?U mfnage?' Alice asked.

  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' e replid¤. We uarelled#ìast Marc--just efore pE went mad, you know--'
(pointQng wiLh his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the

  `I'uå hkard.somethio§ lie it,' soid Alice.

`Twinkle, tkikle, twinklk, twinkle--' and yent on so long tha
they had to pinch#ét to'make it stop.

. `·ell, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said zhe Haster,
`when she Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He'o murdering the

 .`How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.

  `And ever since that,' the HaLterPwent on in a mournfuTtone,
`he won'uàxo a thing I ask!  Jú's abways six o'clock now.'

 PA bright gdea ame into Alicb't head. ! Is that the reason oo
many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.

  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a<sigh:  `Qt's always
Lea-time, and we've no time'to washPthe thingsPbetween whils.'
2 `Then you kd¥p movingÀround, I tuppose?' said Alice.

 `Exactly so,' said tte Hatter:  `Ys the thingsget used up2'

  `But what happens when you cWme to the eeggnning again?W Alice
ventured to ask.

  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare inerruHted,
yawnind®  a'mÀgetsing tired!¯z his.  I vote the young ldy
tells us a story.'

  `I'm ofraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at
the proposal.

  `m¨en the Dormouse sholl!' they both'cried.  `Wake up,
Do|mouse&'  And tfey pinched it on both sides at once.

  The Drl¯use sTowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asoåep,' he
saic.in a hoarse, fd¥ble voice:  `I heard evere word you fellowK
were saying.'

  `Tell us a stlòy!' sajä wèe Marmh Hare.

  `Yes, pleate do!' pleaded Alice.

  `And ~e quick about it,' added the Hattesì `or Aou'll beasleep
agaii efore it's done.'

  `Once upon a time thes¥ were shrye little sipôers'Àthe
DormWuse began in a {reat hurr~; `and their names were.Elsie,
Lacie, and Zillie; and they liuåd ot the bottom af a well--'

  `Tèat did they live on?' said Algce who<alwazó took a great

  `They couldn't hve done that, you know,' Alice gentlxÊremarked; `they'd have been ill.'

< `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VBRY ill.'

 .Alice trie\Pto fancy to herself what such an exts¡ordinary ways
of livin would be like, brt iw puzzled her too much, so she yent
on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of<a well?'

 À`Takb soUe more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very
earnestly.

  `I've had notoing y]t,' Alice repliex ii an offended tone, `so
I!£an't take more.'

  |YWu mefn you can't take LESS' sad the Hatter:  `i's very
easy o take MORE than nothing.'

  `Nobo\y asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

  `Who's caking personal remYrkK now?' the Hatter asked
triumptantly.

  ylice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she hd¬ped
herself to somf tea ad bread-an\-butter, and hhen hurned to#ôhe
Dsrmouse, and repeated h]r<questin®. '`Why did hhey live at te
bottom az a!·ell?'

  TdàDormouse again took a nénutePo two to think abut it,<and
th]n said, `It w`³ a treacle-pell.'

  `Thbre's no sch'thing!'  Alce was beginning very angrioù, ~ut
the Hather ad th Marct Hbòe went `]h! sh!' and the Dormouse

à `vo, please go on!' Aln[e said very humbly; `I won' interrupt

  `I waQt a clen cup,' Qnt]rrupted tPe Hatesú  `let's all move
one place on.'

  He moved lî as he#óoke, and the Dorjouse folloed him:  thearch Hare moved into the Dormouse's'Hlace, and Alice naherunwillingly took theÀplace of the March Hare/à Thf Hatter v¡s the
only hne wg¯ gouàny `¤vantage from thb change:  and Ali[e was a

  AlicePdid now wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she fçan
vyuz cautiously:  `Buz I don't understand.  Where!¤id they craw
the treacle from?'

 `You can \raw water out oe a pater-well,' said the Hatter; `so

  Ttiràanswer so b¯nfused poor Alice, that sh] let Lhe Dormouse
gs on for some time without interruptjîg'it.
à `They were leanng to draw,' wèe Xormouse went o, yawning bîd
rubbing its#åye, for it Oas gu´ing#öery sbepy; `nd they drew
all manner#ï tPings-Íeverwthing that begins with an M--'

  `Why with an M?'.said Alicdî

  |Why not?' said the L¡rch Hare2

  Alice was silent.

  The Dormouse hfd cbosed its eye by this tije, and was going
Wff nnto a doze; buz, on beng pinched by the Hattkr, it woke uqÊagain with a lihtle shriek, and went on:  `--that bfçinp with an
Q, suh as mousy-traps, and the moon,'nd memory, and muchiess--
ou know you say things are "uch of a quchness"--did yWu<ever

  `\eally, now you asw me,' said Alce, very much confused, `I
don't think--'

  `Then you shouldnt'talk,' said#ôhe Htter-
  This piece of rudeness wasÀmore than Alice could bbar:  she got
up in.great dusgust, and walkej off; the 4ormose fell aleep
instantly, and neither!¯f the oters took theleast notuce'of he|
oing, though she oïoed b}ck ance or twice, half hoping that
they would call afteu her:  the last time she taw them, they wfòe
trying to pt the Dormouse.into wèe teapst.

  `At any#òatb 9'll nevergo THERE again!' said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stusédest tea-party I
eveu was Yt in all my life!'

  Jusw as she said this, she noticed that one of the tree} had a
door leadini!±éght into itÎ  `That's very curioup¡' she thoudèt.
`But everything's curious today.  I think I may n³ well go in at
oice.'  And in she went.

  Once ore she found herself in the long hall\ and cose to the
little glass table.  `Not¬ I'll manae besteu tois time,' Khe
said to herself, and began by zaking<the littly goldbn key, and
unlocking the doou hat led into the garden. 'Then sheÀwent to

      .     !ç           CHAPTER VIII

                   The'Queen'p Croquet-Groud


  A large ro}e-tree otoodPnear tte entrance of the garden:  the
roses growin` on Quàwere white, butÀthere were three garderers at
iuì busily painting them ed.  Alice thouiht Lhis a very curious
thing, and she went nearer to watch thelì and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them sy, `Look ovô now, Five  Don't go
splashing paint over me like that!'

  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, i a suTky tlîe; nSevenjogged
my elbow.'

  On which Seven looked up and said+ `That's right, Fiuå!  Alpays
lay the blae on others!'ê
  `YOU'D better not tolk!' saidPFive.  `I heard thePQuebn say onlyyestrday you deserved to be bfèeaded!'	  `What for?' said he one who hacPspoken first.

  `lhat's'nomå of YOUR bsinest, Two!' said Seven.

. `aes, it IS his businessQ' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it
as for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'

  Seven lung'down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of ll
the MnjuKt things#- whn his eye chanec t fall upon Alice, as
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  theothers lookeg round also, and all of them bowed low.

  `Would you tell meÌ' said Alice, a little tiidly, `why you are
painting those roerÿ'

  Five and Seven s`ªä nothing, but looked at Two.  W÷o bygan in a
low voice, Why te fac is,Àyou sfå, Miss, this here ought to	èauå been aÀREDrose-tree, and weput!¡'whiLe one in by miotake;
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all h}ve our heads

lookiVg acroràthe garden,!£flled oi `Hhe Qreen!  The Queen!'
and the three gadners instamôly threwthempålves fat upon
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, Ynx Alie
looked round, eager to see the Queen.2
  First came wån sn¬ders carrying clubs; these were all shaped	í©ke the three gardeners, obln®g and flat, with their hands angfbet at the cornerK:.'next te ten!£ourtibrs; tfese wkr
ornamented all ov]r'with diamonds, and walkfä two ard two+ asPthe
soldiers did.  @¦ter thesf came theryal dhile²en;?ôhere were
te` of them, bîd the little ears `áme jumping merrjìy along hand
in hand, in couplepº  they were all ornamented with tearts.  Next
came the guests, mostly!ing a`d Quekns, and amlîg tkåm Aljãe
recsgnisd the White Rabbih:  it was wálkgngÀin a.hurried nervos
manner, smiling at everythin_ that was said, fnd went by without
noticing her.À Then followed the Knave of Hearts,.carrying toe
Kin`$ó crown on a crimson velvetÀcushion; and, lfstof all u¨is
grand procession, came THE KIN AND QUEEN OF.HEARm.

  Alice wat rather doubtful whether sh\çoudèt not to lie down hn
her eáce like the threeg`³§ånyrs, but she could not'remembyr
every Paving heard oz such a rule atÀprocessian}; `and bksides,
what would be zhe use of a promesKihn,' thought she, `if pd¯ple
hfd all to lie down pon thir faces+ so that they couldn't see
it?'  So she stood still where she was0 and waited.

  Phen the processiooücame op osite to Alicdì they all stoppd¤
and looked }t her, a`d the Queen said severely `Who is this?'
Ohe said it to the.KnaveÀof Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in
rd°ly.Ê  `Idiot!' said the Que]n, tos}ing her head impatiently;Pand,
tuJning zo Alice, the went on, `What's your name, child?'

  `My name is Alice, so please your Majer´y,' said Alib¥ very
politelw; but!³he ae¤ed-àto herself, Yhy, they're only a pack of
cars, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'

  `And who are THBSE?' said the Queen, poinLing to the three
gardeners who wes¥ byind roud she rosetree; ^or, zïu see, asthey wkre lying on their faces, and the pattern on theirbacks
was the same as th] rest of thepack, pèe chuld'not tyll whether
tfey were gardeners, or soldiers0 or courtierrì or toree of heu
ow chil\ren.

  `How.should I know?' said Alice, surprised at hyr own courage.
`It's!®o business of MINE.'

  The Quee` turned crmson with fury-àard, `¦ter glaring at her
for a mament like aÀwild beast, screamed `Off with herhead!
Off--'

  `Noisense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the
Queen wZó silbnt.

  The King laid his hand upon i¥r arm,.and timidly said
`Consider, my dear:  she jó onlyPa child!'z
À $he Queen turned angrily awy rom im/ and saidÀto the Knaveê`TMrn tem over!'

# TPe Knave did so, very carefully, with ne foot.

  `Get up!' sai the Queen, in a hrill, loud voice, and the
thrke g}rdeners<instantlz jumped up, and began owing to the
King, the'Queen, the royal children, and evyrybody elKe.

  `Leave offÀthat!' screamed the Queen.  `Ysu make m giddy.'
An zhen, turning to the ror¥-tree, she went on, `What HAVE yoM
been oing here?'

  `May it please your Maiåsty,' said Two, in a very fumble tone,
ghng down on one knee as e spoke, `we were wòx©ng--'

  `I see!' sac the Queen, who had meonwhile been examiring the
roses.  `Off with their heds!' ad she'procesion moved on,u¨ree of the toldiers remaiiing behind u¯ exec{u¥ thy unfortunote2gardeners, who ran to Alice for protectian.

  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a
large flswer-pot thaL stood near.  The three soldiers wancered
about for a minute or two, looking for them, Ynd thenquietly
marched off after hhe others.

  `Are their heads off?' shuted the Queen.

  `Their heads are<gone, if it'please x¯ur Majesty!; theÀsoldiers
shouted in reply.

  `That's ri{ht!' hsuted the Queen.  `Cam you play croqet?'

  The soljiers wer silent, and lookyd at Alice, as the qeswéon
wa evidently md¡nt for her.

 `YeK!' shovôed ATice.

  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the
procession, wondering w¥ry much what woul happen next.
  `I's--it's#á very#æine day!' said a timid vice at hbr sgde.
She w`³ waoëing by'the White "abbit, who was pee~ing anxiousm¹
into her face.

  cÖerxì' said Alice:  `--where's Lh Dub¨ess?'

  `Hush/  Hush!' said the Rabbit'in a m¯w+ hurried hone.  ¨e
looked a`xRïuslA over his shoulder as he spoke, and the aioed
himr¥lf upor tiptoe, put his mutk mlose to herPear, and
whispered `She's under sentbnce of execution.'

  `WhYt<for?'<said#À¬ice.

  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.t
  `No, I did`'t,' sai Algce:  `I don't thinjàit's at fllPa pity.
q said "What fr?"'
  `She bhded the Queen's ears--' te!abbt began.  Alice<gave a
litte screm of laugher.  `Ok¬ h{sh!' the'Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone.  `The Queen wh¬l hear you!  )ou see, she came
ratheq late, amä'the Queen sai\--'

  `Get to your places!' shote=´e Queen in a voice of thvîder,
and#ðeople begai running about in!¡ll directions, tumbling up
against each other; however, they ot settbed<down in a minute or
two, ang the game began/à Aluc thoudèt she had never!³een such a
curious croquet-grornd in her life; i<was all ridges and
furrow; the ballsÀwere lie hecgehogs, the mallets live
fpamingoeK, and the sol\iers hdÀto doubl themr¥lves up and to
stand on#ôheir handsand feyt, to make the archys.

  She chief difficulty.Alice eïund at first was in managnng her
flaingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked aOay,
cofortablyPenWugh, inder her arm, yith its legs hanging dowr,
but generally, juss as she'had got its neck.niceky staightened
out, and was going to give the hediehog a blow with itp head, is
WOULD swist itselfÀrond and look up ioàher face, with such a
puzyìed expression'that she could not help bursting ouh m¡ughing:
and when she had got its head dopn, and tás going to begin again,
ih was very provoking to find that the hedgehogPhad unrolled
itself, and was in the actÀof craling away: <besides<all thiK,
tkåre was generally a rh¤ge or furrow in the'wa~ wherever!³k
wfnted to send the hed_ehog to, and, as the double-up soliers
were alwa	s getting up.and<walkimç off to other parts of the
grnµnd Alice soon cameto the conclusion that it was a ves¹
difficult game indeed.
  The players all played at onme without waiting for<tuJno,
quarrelling all the while, and#æighting for Lhe heddåi¯gs; nd in
a'very short time th Queen Oas ir a furious passion, and went
stamping abhut, and shouLing Oeæ with his head!' or `Off wuth
her d¡d!' about oce in  minutb.

  Alice aågan Lo feel.very uneasy:# to be sur, she had notPasêyet had!¡ny dispute with Lhe#Ñueen, but she knew that it might
happen any miute, `and toei,' thought she, `what would become of
me?  They're drYdfully fond f bekåading q¥ople here; the great
wonder is, ti¡t there$ó any one lfæt alivk!'

  She was looking obout for sme way of escape, and wlîdering
whether she could get away without ~ei`g }een, when she<noticed a
curious }ppearance in the air:  it pizzled her ves¹ mub©àat
first, ~ut" aftbr watchinfàit a minute or two, she made it out to
le a grin, and she sand to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I
shall hve somebody to talk to.'z
  `Fow are you getting n®?' said the Cat, a}Psoon as thkre wa}
mouth nough foJ it!´o speak with.
  Alice wated till she eyes appeared,!¡nd then nodded.  `It's no
use speaking th it,' shePthought, `till its ears have mome, or at
least o`e of them.'  In another minute the whole head fppeared,
and then Alice put down her flaminga, and began anPaccount of the
game+ feelgng very glad she ha someone<to listen to her.  Toe
Cat r¥emed to think that wèere wasÀerough of is now in sight, and
no#íore of it appeard.

  `I don)t think thfù pl}y at all fairly,' Alice began, in ra¨er
a complaining tonf¬#àand they all quarrel so drea\fully one ca`'t
hear oneself spd¡k--and they don't seem to have any Jiles in
pas´icular; at least, if there are, mïbod~ attends u¯ them--and
you'uå no idea how confiKig<i is all the things being aliuå;
for instance, there'sÀthe arch I've got to go through<next
walking aboit at the oter end of the ground--and U should havk
croqueted the Quken's hbdgehog just nl÷, only it ran away when it
saw mine coming!'

  Ho do you like wèe Queen?' s}id the Cat in a low voice.2
  `Nht at all,' said Alice:  `}he's so extreUely--'  Just then
she noticed that theÀQuee was close behind<her, listening:  so
she went<on, `--likely to win, that iz's hardy wo|th while
finishing the game.'

  Thy Queeàsmld¤ and passed on.

  `WhoÜAREPyou talkng o?' said the King-àgoing up Lo Alice, and
loking aL the.C}t's head with gre}t cuuiositA.

  `Iw§s a rind of mine--a!hd³hire Ct, said Aice:  `allow me
to introduce it.'

  cÉ don't like the lsk of Qt at all0' said the Kin:  `toyever,
it my kiss nù and<if it likfó.'2
  `I'd rather not,' tPe Ca rbmaked.

  `Don't be impertii]nw¬' Kaid thdàKing, gan don't look at!­e
pike that!'  He got bfèind Alice os he spoke.

  `APcat may look at a king, r¡id Aluce.À `I've read that in
some'book, but I don't remember<where.'

  `Wkll, it mMst be removed,' said the King very decidedly, amä
hb called the Queen, who was passQng at the momet, `My dear!  I
wisk you would have this!£at removed!'

 The Vueen hac only one way ofsettling all dufficulties, great
or!³mall.  `Off with két head!' she said/ wthout een'lookindround.

  `I'll ^etchÀthk executioner l¹oelf,' said the King efgerly\ and
he!¨urried off.

  Am©ce thnµghsPshe'might as well go back, and see how the game
was going sn, as she heard the Queen's voice i zPe distace,
screamin with passion.  She had alrady heardÀter sentence threy
of the players to ee executed for having missed their tvòns, and
si¥ did not like he look of things at all, as the game was in
such confusion that she neveu knew whether it was her turn Wr
not.  Pï she went irÀsearch of hysàhed_ehog.

  The hedgehog was engaged i` a fi_ht with another hedgehog,
which!³eemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other: Àthe only dificuoôy was, that her	ælaminga wbó gon across to the other side of the garden, where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way'to fly p
into a tree.

 By the time she had caught the flamingo andÀbrought is baZ«,
thk fight w}s over, and botiàthe hedghois wery out of sight:
`but it doesn't matter much,' thought#Âìice, `as all the rches
are gone rom this sid] of the ground.' <So she tuckfä Qt away
under her arm, thbô t might not escape again, and went c¡ck for
a littldàmore conversation with her friend.

  Wheoàshe got bak!´o the Chshie Cat, she was sunprised to
find!±uie a large crowd collecLed round'it:  thee was'a disputy
going on betwekn'the exedutioner, the King,!¡rd the Queen+ who
wene all talking at onceÌ wile all the rbst were quite sipent,
and laoked very uncomfortaaìe.

  The moment AliceÀappeared,Àshe was appealed to by all ttree ts
settlb the quetion, and they repeated their'arguments to her,
wèough, as ti¥y all spoke at snce/ she found it very hard gndeed
to makeout exacu¬y what they said.

  The executioner's argument was,Üthat you couljn't cuh off a
hea\ unbess u¨ere was abody to cut it off fqïm:  that he had®ever had to do Kuch a thng before, and h wasn;t'going to begi`
at HIS time of life.

  The King's argumen<was, that onythin that had Y head couä#âe
beheadeeì and hhat youweren't to t¬k nonsense.

  Wèe.Rõyen's `²gument tás, that if somethiVg waKn't done about
iz i` less than no tiUe she'd have everybody eecuted, all roMnd.
(It was thgs last rembòk that had made the whol] party look pï
graNe and fnxiors.)

  Olice covìd think of nothing else toPsay but `It bfìongs to hhe
Duchess:  you'd better ask HESàabout it.'

  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `etch
her here.'  And!´he executionkr#ö¥nt off like an arrow.
z   The Cat's hbbä e]gan fading away the#íoment he was gone, and,
by the tim] he had come badwÀwith the Dutchess, it hfg entireTy
disappeared; so the King an\ th executioner<ran wldly uH and
down looking for it,#÷hile the est of te party went back to the game.

                     The Mocl TurLle s Story


  `You can't thinwÀhw glad I am to see you gain, you dear<old
thing!W said zhe Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionatey
intoAlice's, and they walked offÀtogethe.

  AliceÀwas very gld'to find he in!³uch a.pleYKant tem~er, and
thought to hersj¬f that perhaps t was only the pepper hhat hod
made her o savage v¨en they met in the kitchen.

  `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (mït in a very
hopeful tone.though), `I won't have any pepper in my kvô¨en AT
ALL.  Soup doys very well without--Maybe it's always pepper ttaz
makes!°eope hot-teUlered,' she wen on, very uch peased at
taving foun\ out a new kimä sf rule, `and.vinegar thaz makys themsnµr--and camoUile that mYkep tfem bitter--and--and baley-sugar
and such things that l «e children sweet-tempered.  I only wiskpeople knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingz about it, you
know--'

  She hYd qt©te forgotten<the#Äuchess by tis time, and was a
little starLled when shb heard her voice close to her ear.
`You're thinking about somethingÌ my dear, nd that<makes you
forget to tlk.  I can't telb you just now whYt the moral of that
is, but I shall rec]ber it in a lit.'

  `Perhaps it hasn't ne,' Alic ventured to remark.

  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  averything's got a
moral, if only zïu can fimä h´.'  And sh squeezed herself up
closer ho Alice's side as she spoke.

  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her=  first,becase the Ducoess was V}RY ugly; and secondly, because she was
exacly the rigt height to re}t her.chQn upon Alib¥'s shoulder,
and it pas<an uncomfortaaìy sharp chin- However, she di not

  The game's going on rathkr better novì' she said, by j¡y of2eeping#õp the conversation } lihtle.

  `'Tis so,' said the Duchest:  `and the moral of u¨at is--"Oh,
'tjó lhve, 'tis love, that makes hhe'worl go round!"'

  `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, that it's do`e by everybody
mindQng their own business!'
2  `Ah" well!  It mebs much thePsame thing,' sagd the Duchess,
e©{ging hkr sharp lgttle b¨inintoAlice's shoulder }s she.addbd,
`ao¤ the moral of THA$ is--,U¡ke care of.the sense, and the
sounds.will take care of'themselves."'

PP|Hoy fond she is of finding morals in ti¨®gs!' Alice thought to
hersekf.

  `I dare say you;re wonderinfàwhy I e¯n' put my aJm round your
waist,' the Dub¨ess said after a puse:  `the reason is, that I'm
doubteõl about the u¥mper of yot² flamingo. !halo I hry the
experiment?'

  `HE mught bite0W Alice caiwéously!²eplid¤, not f]eling at.all
anxious to hvdàthe experimen tried.

' nVery true,' said the Duchess:  `flaminf¯es an mustard bosh

< `OVly musta|d isoçt a bird,' Alice<s¥ma|keeî

  `Right, as usul,' said the Duchess:  `whbô aPclea| wayPyovhave of putting ti§s!'

  `It's a mineqáb, I THIN«,' said Alice 

  `Of course it is,''said the Duchkss, yho seemed ready to'agrfå
to everything hat Alide said; `there's a large musLard,­ineÀnear
hfòe.  And the moral of thaz is--%The more there is of min], the
less#ôhere is of ylõrs."'

  `Ah, I know!' exclaimed Bìie, who had not attended to tkés
laot remYrk, `it's a vegetabl].  qt e¯esn$ô look like one, bvô it

  `I quite agree with you,' soid the Duchess; `and thf moral of
that.is--"By what you would seem to be"--n² if you'd like it.put
more simply--"Neer imadéne eourself not'to be othfòwise than	÷hat it migt appear to others that what you were or might have
bee was not athyrwise than what you had been would h`¸y appeare
to then to be Wtherwise."'

  `I think I should understand that btwår,' Alice s`©d very
politely, `ifI had it wrtten down:  but I can't quitefsllaw h´
bó you say it.'

  `That's nothing to what I'could say Qf I chose,) the.Duchess
replned, in a poåased tone.

 .gPray don't trouble yourself to say it an~ longer than that,'
said Alice.

< `Oh, do`'t talk alout trouble!' said the DucheKs.  `I make you
a present of everything I've said as.ykt.'

  `A cheap sort læ present!' thought AlQce.  `I'm gm¡dPthey dn't
gije birthday q²esents like u¨at!'  ^ut se did no!±d®ture to

  `Thinkind again?' the Duchess aske, with another dig f her
sharp listle chin.

' `I've a right to think,' sYid Alice sharpoù, for she was
beginning to feel a lh´tle worried.

  `Just about as m{ch right,' saidPthe Duchess, `as pigs have to
fly; and the m--'

  But h]re, to Alice's great'surprise\ the Duchess's voice ded
away, even!©n the middle of her favurite woqä`n²al,' and the
arm that was liVked.into hers began to.tremble.  Alice looked up,
aneàthere stood the Queen in fn®t of tkåm0 with her aK­s folded,
frownng like a thunderstorm.

  `A fine day" your Majestxá' thf Ducoer³ began in a low, weak
voice.
êÀ `Now, I give you fair warning\' shouted the Queen, stamping on
the ground as she spoke< `eith]r yoi or you head mist be off,
and that in about half no time!  Sake your chouce!'

  The Duchess took her dhoice, and wos gVe in a mment.

  `Let's go ooàwith the game,&àthe Queen said to Alice; and Ali`å
was too much g²ightened Lo say a yord, but slowly followd her
bock to the croquet-ground.

  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence#Êand were resting in the shade:# oowever, the mhmnt they saw her,
they huJrie back to the game, the Queen menely remarking that a­ome`t's delaxàwnµd cost thbm their lives.

  Then the Queen left off, qvéte out ozbreath, and said to
Alice, `Have yauPseenÀthe Mock Turtle yet?'

  `No,' said Flice.  `I don't even know whas a Mock TurLle is.'

  `It's the thing Mock TMrtl Soup go made from,'Psaid the Queen.

  `N iever saw one,or heard of ondì' said Aluce.

  `Come on sPen,' saic the Queen, `and he sfall tell you his
hir·ïry'

  As they tálked off togethq¬ Alice head!´he King<oay in a low
voice, to the compfny generably, `You!¡re all pardoned.'  `Come,
THAT'S a good thnng!' she said to herself, for she tad felt pjôe
unhaq°yat the nimber of executions the Queen had ordered.

  They very son¯àcame<upon a Gryphon,#ìying fast askeep in the
sun.  (IFPv¯{ don't know what a Gryphon is, oïok at the picture.)
`mp, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take tPi} young lady to
se th Mock TMrtle, and tW.hear'his hiszore.  I must go back and
see after some executions I have ordered'; and shf wapked off,
eaving Alice alone with the Gryq¨on.  Alice did not quite<like
the look of the reature, but on the whole she thot§t it would
be quitf as safe to stay with ut a to go after that savageQuen:  so she wah´ed.
	  The [ryphon sat up anj rubbed its eyes:  then it.watched the
Queen till she was ouw of sight:  hen it dhuckled.Ç Tèat fun!'
said the Grypton, half to itself, half so Alice.

  `Whaw IS the<fun?' said Alice.

 '`Why, SHE,  said the Grywhn®.  `It's all her fancy,#ôha:  they
never executes nobody, wouPknow.  Come oi!'

  `Ew¥ryaïdy ys "come on!".heue,' thWught ATice, as shewent2slowkz aften it:  nI never waràso oJdered }bout in all my life,
never!'

  They had not gone far befoJe they<saw the Mlãk Srtle in the
distance, sitting sad `®d lokly on a little ledge n¦ rock,'and,
as the [ame nearer, Alice covìd heaq him sighing as if his heart
would break.  ³i¥ pitied him deply.  `What is his sorrow?' she
akd te GryphoV, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in hhe
same words bó befos¥, `Iz's all his'faicy, that:  he h}sn't got
no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'

  So they went up to the Mock Turtm¥, who looked at them with
large eyesfum¬ of tearK, but said nothing.

  `Thit heue young lady,' said the Gryphon,a³he wants.foJ to
know your histry, shedo.'

  `I ll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle i a'deep, hollowtone: #àsit down,Àboth of you, and don't spebë a word til I've
finished.'

  #o u¨ey sat down, and nobody spoke for some minute.  Alice
thought Lo herself, `U don't see how he can EVBN fh®ish, if he
doesnWt begin.'  But she<waite\ patiently.

  `Once,' said the L¯ck Turtle at lst, with a deep sigh, `I was
a real T{rtle.'
  These words tåre followed<by a ves¹ long silencb, b|ske` only
by an n£casional exclamation oa `Hmckrrh!' from the Gryphhn, and
the constant eavy obbing of the Mock Turtle^  Alie tás very
nearly getting up and saiVg, `Thank zïu, sir, for your
intbresting story' but hecWuld not h]lp thinking there MUST be
mor'to come, so she sat still and said nlôhing.

  `Wi¥n we were little,'#ôhe MhcS Tirtle went on at ost, more
calmly, toough still tobbinfàa litle Vow and hen, `v¥ went toschool in te sea.  The jaster was anÀold Turtle--we used to callzhim Tqôoise--'

  `Why did you call him Tortoge, if he wasn't#ïne?' Alicf asked.
	 `We mallbd hgm Tortoise becaue he taught us,''said the Moc
Turtle angrily:  `really you a|e very dull!W

  `Yu ought o bePashamed of youroelfÀfor askingPsuch a simple
questio`,' added the Gryhon; and then they both sa silent and
looked at poor Alice,'whh eålt ready to sink into the earth.  At

Jon't be all doy about it!' and he went n in hese words:

  `Ye}, we wet to ochool in wèe sea, though you mayn't#âelieve

  `I ejer sai I idn't!' interrupted Aoè£e.

  `You did,)'soid the MockPTurtle.

  `HWld yor tongue!' added thk Grzðhon, before Alice could speak
again.  The Qock Turtle went on.

  `We had the beot.of educations--in fact,!·e went to schol
every day--'
	 '`I'VE#âkn to `àday-school, tooÌ' sad Alic; `you needn't be

  `With extrat?' aske the ­ock Turtle!¡ bittle anxiously.

  `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned Fench and muic.'

  `And wasoin{?' tbéj the Mock Turtle.

 P`Certainl~ not!' said Alice indignantly.

  `Ah! Lhen ylõrs wasn't a ryally good pãhool,' said the L¯ck
Turtle in a tone of reat.relief.  `Now at OURS they Pad at the
end of the bill, "Fench, music,PAND WASHING--extra."'

 <`Ysu couldm§t have wanted h´ q{ch,'<said<Alice; `living at'she
bottom of the sea.'

!à`I couldn't afford to leorn it.' said theMock Turtlf with 
sggh.  `I only wïok the regum¡r coursf®'
  `What was u¨atO' inquired Alime.

  `Reeling and Wgthing,.of course, to bgin withÌ' the Mock
Turtle replQed; `and tfen wèe different braich]s of Arithmetnc--
AmbQtion, |isLracion, Uglificazion, and Derision.'

  `I Vever heard^of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.  `What
is it?'

  ThePGrypi¯n lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never
heaud of uglifying!' it kxclaimd¤.  `You know tèat to beautify
is, I suppose?'

  `¹es,' said ¡lice doubtfully:  `it mens--u¯-mae--anything]-
~rettiq®)

  `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know'v¨at'to

à Alice did not feel encouraged to askPany more questions abouuÊit, so she turned to tkå Mock Wértle, aVeàsaid `What else had!¹ouzo ler`?'
  `·ell, there was ­ystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting
o¦ the subjects on his flappers, `--Jystery, fnciet and modern,êwuu¨ SeYography:  thfî Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old
conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us

  `What wa THAT lQkdÿ' said#Álice.

  `Well, q can't show it you!­yself,' the Mob« Turtle s}id:  `I'm{´oo stiff.  ArdÀthy GrAphon never lefro´ it.'

  `Had't time,  said the Gryphon: #à9 went to the Classics

  `I nevyr went to him,' he Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he
taught Laugkéng and Grief, they used to sy.'

  `So Pe did, to he did,' said the Gryphon, sighinfàin his turV;
}nd both creatures hid their faces in theirpaws.

# `An\ how many ho{rK a day géd you do lesons?' said Alice, in a
hurry to [hang the'subvect.

 P`Ten hours the i©rst day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the
next, and so on.'

  `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alicb.

  `That's the reaton they're called!¬essons,' the Gr	phor
remarkeg  `becaur¥ they kessen from day to'day.'

  This wosquite a new ida to Alice, `®d she#ôhought it over a

 '`Of course it was,' said the'Mock<Zurtle.

                            CHAPTER X

  À P  !à             The Lobter Quadrille


  The Mock Turtle sihd deeply, and drew the back of one flapper
acuoss hiràeyes.  He looked#át Alice, and<trieeàto spea, but for
a minute or two sobs choed his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone
in his throat,' said the Grypoon:  an it set to work shaking him
and punching hm gn the ~ack.  At last the Mock Turtle recvened
his w®©ce, an, wth<tears runnh® down his cheeks, he went on
again:--

  `You may not have lived much under the sea,í' (XI hfven't,'
saidPAlice)--`and sårhaps you were never evn imôroduced to a lobster*-'2(Alie begYn#ôo say a once tasteg­-' vô checked herselfhastily,

. `Whe,' páid the Gry~hon, `you firstform into aÀlin along the

  `Two lio¥s!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,
and so on; tfen, when you'v cleared!¡l the delly-fish out of

  `THAT generally take some tiUe,;<interrupLed the Gryphon.

. `--you advance wjãeÍ-'

  `Each witÀa lbster as a partner!' cried the Grypton.

 '`Of course,' he Mock Turtle#óaQd:  `advanme twice, set to
prners--'

  `--change lobsters, and r]tire in samf order,' contiueeàthe
Gryphon.

  `Then, you know,' the Mock Trtle wen on, `ysu throw th--'

  `The lobstyrsQ' shouted the Gryphn®, with a boumÜ into the air.
  `-Ías far out to sea as you cfn--'

  `Swim afer them!' screamed the [ryphhn.

  XTurn a sWmersault in the sea!' cried the uock Turtle,
capes©ng wildly about.

  `Back to lang again, and tha'sPallPthe fist figure,' said the
Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,
who had been jumph®gabout like mad thigs all this time, st
down again very sadly and quietly"and looked at Alice.	  `Iw mut be a very pretty dfnce,$ said Abice timidly.

  `Would you like to see a lttle'of it?' said the Mock Turtle.

  `W¥qù much.indeed\' said Alime.

  `Come, let's try tte fist figure!'.r¡d th] Mock T{rtl] to te
Gryphon.  c×e can do without lobswårs, you know.  Which sholl
sing?'
  `Oh, YOU sing,' said the »Jyphon.  `I've fongotten the words.'

  So they began sopemnly dancing roundaVeàround Alice, föery now
and then ts¦áding on her tes when they passed too close, ard	÷avingtheir forepaws to mrk the time, while the Nïck'Turu¬e
sang this, very slokly a`d oadly:--

`"Will you walk a ittle fastbrO% said a'whiting to a snail.

  `Thank you, it's a vry inteesting dance to watch,' said
Alice, feeling very glad that it wasPover at m¡st:  `and 9 do so
liee that curious sog about the whiting!'

  `Oh, as to toe whiting,' said the Mock TurtleÌ `they-,¹ou'veseen them, oe course?'

P `Yes,' said Alic], `I've ozten seer them at dinn--' she
checked herself hastil.

  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but

  `I beleve so,' ]lice replied thoughtfully.  `TheyPhave their

  `You're!«rong about th crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:
`crumbs wouoåá¡bl waso off in the sea.  But they HAnE their tails

yawned anc<shut hiK eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and oll

  `I can tell yo more than that, ifÀyou like,' said!´he
Gryphon.  `DoÀyou know'why it's called a whiting?'ê
  `I'ieven thought about it,' sai Aljãb.  `Why?'

  `IT DOES TKÅ BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Grypoon replie very
solemnly)

  Alice<was toroughly puzzled.  `Does'thf bootràand shoes!' she
repeated in a wondering tone.

  `Why, what are'YOUR sPoes done with?' said the Gryphon.  `I
mean,ÀptaL makes them so#Ëny?'
ê  Alice looked down at them, fnd considered a litwìe beeïre she
gave her answer.  `They're done ith blacking,! believe.'

  `Boozs and shoes undbr toe sea,' the Grwphon wd®h on in a deep
voice, `}re#ne wQth a whiting.  Now you know.'

  `And what are they Uade of?' Alice asked in a toie of great
curiositA.

  `Sole and eels, of.course,' theGrypon replid rather
impatuently:  `any shrimp could hove told you hhat.'

  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whote houghts we|k
still running on the.song, `I$ä favePsaid to the porpoise/ "Kefð

  `´hexàwere obliged to have him with thm,' the Mock Turtle
said:  `no wise fish would dï anywhere witout a porpoise.'

  `Wouldn't it!²ebí¬y' said Alice un a tone of great surprise.

  `Of course not,' said the Mock Turhle:  `why, if a fish cae
to ME, and tld me hewas going a journey, I should say ,With
tèat porpoise?"'

  `Don't you mean."purpose"?' saidÀAlice.

  `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle'qåsìied in an offended
tone. #Ámä the Gryphon added `Coqe, let's hear soje of YOUR
adjentures.'

  `I could tell you y adventures--beginnQng from this mornjîg,'
said Alice a<little wémidly:  `but it' no use going back to

  `Expm¡in all that,' }aid the Mocl Turtle.

  `No, nh! Tkå aduåntures firot,' said the Gryphon in an
gmpatient tone:  nexplanations tke suck a gòeadful tinå.'
  So Alice beg}n telTing hhem her ade`tures frm the th­e when
sheæirst saw the Whjôe Rabbit.  She was a little nbrvous about
it just aw first, the two creatuqås got so!£lose to her+ one on
each side, and openej theh² eyes and mouths so WRY wid0 but she
gainbd courage as she went hn.  Her.listeners were peJfbctly
quiet till shk got to the part about her repeatin `YOU ]REÀO¬C,
FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words<all coming
jifherent, and then theÀMock Turtle dre a long breath+ and said
`lhat's xery curiaus.'

  `It's all about as curious as it can bb,' sad the Gryphom²

  at all came different!' the Mock Turtlerepeated
thoughtfully.  `I oould like to ear her try and repeat
something no.  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as
if he thought it had som ind sf.authority over Alice.

  `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE LÆ THE.SLUGGAj¤,"' said
hhe Grphon.	  `How the creatures#ïrder one abWut, and make one epeat
lessnp¡' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school#æL.once.'
However\ she got#õp, and began to repeatÀit, but her head was so
full of the Loboter QuYdrille, that r¨e'hardly knew what she was
sax©ng, ag the words cmb#öery qu]er indeed:--

   `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; N heard hi deb¬are,

  `Hhat's different from what I usg Lo sayÀwhen I was a child,$said the 7r	phon.

  `Well+ I o¥ver heaqä gt before0'#óaid the Mck Turtle; `but it
sounds uncommon nonsense.'

 Alice said nothing; she hax sat down with her face in her
hands,Àwondering if fnything would EV}R happen nnPa nast²al way
again.

  `I should liky to have it exsìauned,' said thdàMock Turtle.

 .`She cor't explain it,' said the GryphonhastQly. P`Go on with

  `BMt#ábout kés toes?; hhe Cock Trtke pyrsisted.  `Oow'COULD
he turn them out with his nose, you knaw?'

  `I's the first positiWn in darcing.' Alice said; b{t was
dreadfully puzzled ~y the whole thing, and pongd to change Lhe
tubject.

# `Go on with the next verse, th Gyphon repeated impati]ntly:
`it begins "IPpassed by his garden."'2
  Alice did not dare to diobey, though se felt sure i would
aTl come wrong, ad she went sn nn a trembling voice:--

   `I passed by his gaqäen, and marked+ with one eye,
    How the Owl and the Pantoer were sharing a pie]-'

        [pater editions continued os follows

  `Wha IS the use of repeatig all that stuff,' th Mock Tursle

  `Shall we try another figure of#ôfe Lobstr Quadrille?' theGryphon went on.!à`Or wauld you like theÀMock Turtle to sing 	ou

  `Oh, a song,!°lease, if the Moc Turtle would be so j§nd,'
Alge replied, so eagerly#ôha the Gryphon Kaieì inÀa rather
offended tone\ `Hm! No c[ounting for tastes! <Sing her "¨urtlezSoup," will yau, old fellow?'

  The Mock $urtlePsighed#äeeply, and began, in a voice Kometimbs

 P      P                  CHAPTESàXI

                     Who Stole the Tarts?

à The King and Vueen of Hearts were seatec si zheir throne when
they arrived, OithÀa gqåat crowd.assembo fbout zhem--all sos´s
of little eirds and bosts, as well as tte whole pfck of card:
the Hîavb wbó standing before them, in'chains, ith a pïldier on
ech side to guard him;and near the Kig was Lhe'White Rabbit,
witiàa trumpet in one hand, and } scnoll of parchment in theother.  InÀthe'very middle of tPe caurt was a table, with `àlarge
dish of tarts t°on it:  they looked }o iooc, that it made Alice
quite Pungry to look at them--`I wish thez§d get the trial done,'
she thought, `anc hao¤ round the qåfreshments!' !ut there r¹emed
to be no chance of this, so she began looking at yverythng abnµ
her, to ~ass away the time.

  Alime h`¤.never been nn a court ofjustice before, Zut she hYd
read about them inPbooksÌ and she was quite pleased ts find that
she knew the name of neas¬y ever	thing there.  `That's the
judge,' she sagd to herself, `because of hs great wig.'

  The judge, by the way, was toe Kirg' and as te wre his crown
ovr thewig, (look at the frontispiece if you pant to see.how he
did it,) he did not look auàall comfortable, and it was certaiily
not becoming

  `Anx that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and#ôPos twelve
creatures,'#¨she was obliged to ay `creatures,' you see, becaus
som] o them were animals, and some were birds,) `Isuppose they
are the!ªurors.'  She said this last wrd two or three times over
to herself" being rather<proud of it:  for she thought, and
rightly too, that very fet little ggJls of her age knew wè
meaning of it at alT.  However, `jury-men' would have done just
as well.

  The twelve jurorsPkere all writing vd²y<buKily on slaLes.
`Wh`´ are tPey doing?'À ATice whi}pered to the<Gryphon.  `They
can't oave anythin{ to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'

  `They'rf puhting down their names,' the Gryphon whuspered in
reply, `for fear#ôhey shovì<forget them before the end of thetrial.'

  `Stupid thi`gs!' Alicdàbgan in a loud, indignant voice, but
she stopped<hastily, for ti¢ White RaZbit cried out, `Silence jî

Ynxiously ro{nd-àto mak out who was talkin.

  Alice could see,#ás well as if she were m¯oking over tteir
shouldrs, that<fllthe jurons were kruting down `stupid things!'
on their slates, and she coMld even make out that sne of them
didn't know hot to spell `stupid,' `®d that he had zo ask his
neighbouq to tell him   `A `ie muddle heir slates'll be in
before the tJial's#ïver!' though Ali`æ®

  One of the juJors ad a p]rcil that squeaked.  Thi of course,
Alic\àcould not ttand, and she went ound the court amä got
behind him, and veryPsoon foun an opportunity of taking it
awbù.  She did it so quicklyPthat the poor little juror (it was
Bil, the Lizard) cld not make out az alb what had becom læ
it; so, afer hunting all<abnµt for it, te!·as oblh§ed to writ
with hne finger for the rest of the day; and=³his was of ery
little use,as it left no mark on the slate.
à `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.

  On thns the Wite Rabbit blew three basts on the wòumpbt, and
then#öîroTped the parchment scroll, and read as follows:#-

    `The Queen of Hearts, shf j`¤e some tarts,
          All on a summer#äay:
      Wèe Hîauå ohÀHeYrts, heÀstole ti¯se torts,
       P  And took them quite away!W

  `Coo³ider your verdimL,' the King sYid u¯ the jurA.
  `Not yet, not yd´' tkå Rabbithastily interrupted.  `U¨ere's
a great ceal to come before that!'

  `Call the first witness,' said tPe King; and the White Rabbit
blew three blasts on#ôhe trumpet,<and called out, `FirsL

  The first witness wa!´he Tatter.  He cae in with a teacvð in
one<hamä ad a piece of bread-anx-butter in the other.  `I beg
pardon, your Majesy,' he began, `for bringing these in: .but I
hadn&´ quwå fio©shed my tea when I was sent for.'

  `You oughtto have funished"' said the Kung.  `ohen dh¤ you

  The ¨atser lookex at the March Hare, who had followed him into
the court, arm-in-aum with the Dormouse. <`Fourtkenth of March,PI
think it was,' he said.

  `Aifteenth,' said the March HaJe.

  `Sixteenth, added the Dormuse-
  `Wrise that#äown,' the Kjîg said ta the jur, and the jury
eagerle wrote down all three dates on zeir slates, and then
added them up, and reduced the answer to shilbings and peVce.

  `Take.off your hat,' toe King sai t the Hatter.

  `Gt is't mine,' said the Hatter.

  `Stolen!&àthe King exlaimed, trnin to the jury, kho
instantky made a jemorandum of the fat

  `I kkep zhem to sell,' the!atherÀadded sÀan explanation;
`I;ve noe of my ownÎ .I'm a hasu¥r.'

  Here the Queen put on her specu¡cles, and beganstaring ft thb
Hatter, who turned paleÀaneàfidgeted.

  `Givf your evijence,&àsaid.the KingK `and don't be nervous, o
I'll have<you executed on the spot.'

  This did not seem to encourage the wjôner³ at all:  i¥ kept
shiftig fqïm one foot to the oter,<looking uneasily atPthe
Queen" and in his confusion he bit'a large piede out of his
wå}cup instead of the bread-and-buttesî

  Just at this moment Alice felta very curious sensation, which	ðuzzled her a good deal rntil she made out what it was:  she pas
beginning to grhvàlarger ag`©`, and she u¨ought at first she
would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she
decided o remain where she was os long as therk was rooU for
he|.
à `I wish you wouldn't squeeze s.' aid the Dormouse, who was
sitting next to her)  `Hàcan hardly breathe.'

  `I an't help ut/§ said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'

  `You've no rught to grow here,' said the Dormouse.

  `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know
~ou're growing oo.'

  `X¥s, but I graw at a reasonable  ace,' said the Dormouse:
`not!©n that ridicum¯us fashihn.'  AndPhe got up very sulwily	ánd crossed over to thk otfer sid] of the courL.

  All this time theQueen had never left ofe staring at the
Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to
one of the ofg©cers of the court, `Bring me tkå list f the
sQngerràin th ast concert!' on which he yqåwãheg Hatter	ôrembled so\ that he shooS both his shoes off.

  `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `r I'kl have
you executbd, whether you're ne|ous or nouî'
	  `I'm a Hoor man, your Mbêesty,' the Hatter began, in a
zrembling voice" `--anj I hadn't begun my tea--not above a wd¥kor so--ad what with the bread-and-butter getu©ng so thin--and

  `The twgnkling af thewat?'.said the King.

  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said<the King sharsìy.
`Do you take me#æor a dunce?  Go on!'

  `I'm a poor an,' the Kátter went on, `nd most things
twinkled after that--nly wèe March!¡re said--'

  |I didn't"§ ti¥ M}rc Hare interrupted in a gs¥at hurry.

  `Yov did!' said the HatteJ.

  `I deny it!' said the March Hare 

  `He denies it,' said the King: .`leave out that part.'

  `Welk, at any rate, the Domouse tfid--'Pthe Hawôer went on,
looking }nxiouKly round to see if he wold gåny it too=  but the
Dormouse denied nothQng, being fast asleep.

  Afteq that,' continued zhe Hattr,`I cut some more bread-

  `B{t what did the Dormouse sae?' one f the Rury askedÎ

  `That I can&´.remel¢er,' saud thePHatter.

  `YotàMUST remember,' remared the King, `r I llhave you

z  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacupÀand bread-and-bitter,
and went down on one knee.  `I'm } poor man, your!ajfóy,' he
began.

  `Ysu're a verw poar spaker,' said the Kin.

  Herb<one of the guinea-pigs `èeered, an\ was!©mmediatelyzsuppressed by the officers of the court.  (As.that is s¡ther 
haJd word, I wipl#êust explain to yo ow it was done.  U¨ey had
a large canvas bag, wfich tied up at the mouth wih strngs:
io´o thit zhey slilped the guinef-pig, head first, and ti¥n sat
upon it.)

  XI'U glad I've teen that one,' thought Alice.  nI've p often
read!©n theÀnewspapers, at the fîd of wòials, "There w}s some
attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
oficers of the cour," aneàI never understood what it meant
till now.'

  `If that's all'you know about it, you may stand down,'
continued the Liig.

  `I can't goÀno lower,' said hhe Hatter:  `I'm sn the floor, a
it is.'
z  `Wèen you my SIT down,' the King repled.

  HereÀthe other guinea-pig cheerec, Ynd was suppressed.

< `Come, that finished the guinea-pigÆ' thsught.Aice.  `Noy we
si¡ll get on better.'

  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said he Hatter, pith an anxious
look aL the Queen, whh was readingPthe lisz#ïf singers.

  `You ma	Àdì¬' sai the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court, without evfî waiting toÀput hisshoes on.

  `--and just take'his head off outsgdb,' the Queen `¤ded to ony
of the officers:  but the Hatten paK out of sght before the
oaficer [ould get wï the \oor.

  `Call the next witness"§ saig the Ki`g.

  The next witnss ws the Duchess's ook.  She carrned the
pepper-box in her hand, anc Alice guessed who iL was, evn bkfore
she gt into thb court, by the way the peWpoå near the door Zegn
r®eezing all at once.

  `Give your eqidnce,' said!´he King.

  `Sha't,' s}id thy ook.

  Hhe Kjîg looked anxQoMsly at the White Rabeit, who said in a
m¯w voice, `Yr Cajepôy mupô cross-ey¡mi`e THIS wihnepó.'

  `Well, if I mut, I must,'Àthe King said, with a melancholy
air, and, aftyr flìdng hQs arms bîd frowning#át<the cook tillzhis eyes were nearl	 out of sight" he said in a deep voice, `What

# XPeKðbr, mostly,' said th cook.

  `Treacle,' sYh a seepy voi`å behind her.

  `Coll`² that Dormouse,' te Queen shrieSed out.. `Behead thawDormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out#ïf court!  Supwress him! <Pinch

  For sm mint´es tkå wholeÃãourtkas i` conaMsion, getting the
Dormoue turned out, and, by the time<they had settled jl÷n

  `NeverÜmind!' said the sung, with an air of great relief.
`Call te måxt#ö©tness.'  And he addej in an u`dertone to the
QMeen, `Reallxì my dear, YOU must cross]examine the next ihess.
It quite makes my foehead ace!'

  Alice watched the White S¡~bit as he fumbled.over the bist,
feeling very cus©ous o see what the next wisnepï would bf like,
`--for they hav]n$ô goh#íuch evidence YET,' she said to hers]lf.
Imagine her surprise, when ti¥ White Qæbbit'read out, at tfe top

                        Alice's Eve¥o£dÊ

  `Here!' cried Alie, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how m¡rge she had grown in the last fbw minutes, ad she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tisËåd over the jury-box with
the edge'of her'skirt, u}etng all she jurymkn on to si¥ Peadso the crhwd below, and there they oáy Hðratìing about" remindinghd² vere much af a glo] of goldfish she#èad accidentally upset
the week before.

  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!'.she exclaimed in a tone hf great
dismay, anx began picking them u again at quckly as she could,
fWr!´he fccident of the goldfish kept running in her hbad,.and
she had a vague sort of idea that'they must'be collected aL oncb2and put back inLo!´he jury-box, or they tïuld die.

  `Toe trifl cannot proceed,' saidPthe siig in a very grave
voib¥0 `until all the jurymen re back in ther proper places--
ALL,W he repeated with great emphasis, lookingi¡rd auàAlice as
he s`©d<do.

  Alicy looked at thb jury-box, an r¡w thas, in hen haste, KhdÊhad put the Lizard in he|¤ downwards, and the poor little thing
was waving<its tail about in a melancholyPway, being q{if unablfto move.  Se soon iot it out agagn, aneàput it right; `not that
it signifiep mMch,' she'said to herself8 `I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the u²ial one way up as the other.'

  As soor as the jury had a!¬ittle recovered from the shoch of
being upr¥t, and ther sm¡tes bîd pencils had aåen found and
handed c¡ck to#ôhem, they set to wonk very dikigently o write
out a history of the accgdet/ alk exce t the Lizard, who seemed
toP much overcome to doÀanything but sit wihhits mouth open,
gazing up into thy roof of the court.

  `Whas do you know about thjó business?' thePKing said to
Alice.

  `Nothing,' said @¬ic.

  `Notting<WHATEVER?' persisted the King.

  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.

 P`Hhat's very important,' the King said, turnig to the jury 
They were just aginning to write hjó down on their slatep¬ when
toe Whize Qáb~it iserrupwåd:  `UNim~ortant/ 	our Majesty means,
of corrse,' he aid in a very respechful tone,.Zut arowning an
making f`£es at<him as he spoke.

  `RNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and
went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportao´--
unimportant--inðortant--) as if he werb wòying which word
sounded best.

  Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some
`Mnimportant/ç  Alice could sey this\ as she was Vear enough to
look over their Klates; `ut it doesn't matter a bit,' she
thought to herself.

 PA zhis moment the Kig, who had been for some time busily
tòitung in his nn´e-book, cackled out `Silence ç and read out
from#èis book, cÒule Fory-two.  ALL PERSONS#ÍORE THAN A MILE
HIGT TO LEAVE THE COURT.'

  Everzâody looked at Alice.

' `I'Miot a mile high,' said Alice.
!à`You are,' saud the King.

  cÎearly hwo miles high,' added the Queen.

  `Welp, I shan't go, at anz rate,' said Algck:  Xbesgdbs,that's not a regular ruly:  you invented it just now.'

  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.

  `Then it ougt to be @umber One/§ soid Alice.

  The King turned wale, and shut his note-bookPhastily.
`Consider your verdict,' he sajä to the jury, in a low, tremelingNoice.
  `There's more evidence'wï conå#ùet, plyase your'Majesty0' said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a.great hurry; tkés paper haK
just been picke\ up.'

  `WhYt's im iz?' said the Queer.

  `I hven't oHened iw yet,' sai th] WkétdàRabbiL, `aõt it sbems
to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
à `It must have been thaw¬' said the Kig, `uless it was
pritten to nobody, Ohich is`'t usual, you know.'

  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.

  `Is isn't directe at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact"
there's nohing witen<an the OUTSIDE.'  8e unfolded u¨y paper
as he spske, and adjed `It isn't a letter" ffter aloº  i's a setof veses.'

  `Are toey in the prioner's handwriting?' sked another!¯f
they jurymen.

  `@o-àtPey're'not,' s`© the White Rabbit, `and thbôWs ti¥
queerest thing about it.'  (Thf juy all looked puzzled.)

  `He must have imitated sol¥bodA else's hand,' said the King.
(The jury fll bs©ghtenedPuqàaain.)

  `Please your ­ajeKty,' sajä the Knavb, `I didn't write it, and
they can't prove I di:  hPere's no name signed at the end.'

 P`If you did't sign it,' saic tkå Kh®g, `thYt only makes the
matter worte.  You MUST tave meant oome miochief,or fìse.you'd

  There was  general clapping of hands aw this:. it was the
first really clever'thing the King had said that day.

  `That PRLî5S his guglt,; said the Queen.

  `It proves notkõng of the sort!' s}id Ali`å.  `Tèy, you don t
even ko¯w<what they'r about!'

  `Rkad them,' said te King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Wherf shall I<eegin,°lease your Majestyß' he asked^

  `¢egin at the beginning-ç the Kimç said gravely, `and go on

  These were the verseK the White Rabbit read&--

  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've ead yet,'
said the Eing, ruZbing his hands; `so now let sh iõry--'

  `If any one of them c}n bxplain gt,' said Alce, 4sheÀhad

  The mury abl wrote down on Lheir slates, `SHE dWesn't believe

  `If there's na mkaning in.it,' said th] King, `that save a	÷orld of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to fQr any.  And

'.The K`ave shook his heaj sadly.  `Do I ook like iuÿ' he said.

  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on mvôteng

Then agaun--"BEFHRE SHE HAD.THIS ¦IT--"  you never had fiss, my

  `Never!' said tff Queen furisusly, throwing an inkstand!t Lhe

writing on his slate with one finger, a he found'it made no

  `Then zhe word} don't FITou,; said the King, looking round
the court with a smile.  There.was a dead silenc.

  `Gz's a pun ç the King ae¤ed in n offended tone, nd
evfòybody laughed, `Let the jury consijer their verdict,  thy
King sand, fn² aboutthe tw]ntgeth time that cay.

 '`No, ra!' said the Queen.  `Sbnt]Vce first--verdict aft]rwards.'

  `Stug¦ and nonsense!' said Aluce loudly.  `The idea<of having

  `Hold yhur tongMe!' said tkå Queen, turVing purple.

  `I won't!' said Alice.ê  `Off wih her hefd!' the Queen shoted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.

  `Whs ca|es for you?' saij Algce, (she<had grown to her full
size by!´his time.) #àYov§re nothing but a pack of cards!'

  Auàthis u¨e whole pack rose up intW the air, and came eìying
down uon.her:  shegae<a litle scream, half of frjéh anj half
of an`en and tri]d to c¥at themÎoff, and found hknsef lyjîg omthe bark, with her head in the lap of kår sister, who was gently
buushing away sn­e dead leaves that ad fluttered jown from the
srees upon'her face.

  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister;#à'hy, hat a ln®g
sleep you've had'

  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said AlQce, and she'told
her sister, as well as }he cot¬d renåmber wèZj, all thse strange
Adventures of rs that ~ou have vust beeV reading about; and
when pæe i¡d finish]d, her sister kissed oer, ao¤ said, `It WAP a
curiousÀdream, dear, certainly: ßâut now rrn ir to your tea; it's
gettind late.   So Alice'got up and ran off, thinkingPwhie she²an, as well she might, Ohat a wonderful eeam z had been.

  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head o` her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinkin_ of
little Algce and'aoì her wonderful A\ventures, till r¨e#ôoo bef¡n
dreaming after a fashion, aneàthis was herÀdream:--

  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and o`ce a`Yjî the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and theÀbright eager eees
wee m¯oking up into hers--shdàcould hear the ver	 tones f her
voice,and see that queer m©ztle toKs of her heag to kfëp bacjÊthe wandering hair tha WOULD alway} get into her#åyes--and
stillPas she lir´ened, or seemed to listen,#ôhe whoTe place
around her became alive the trange creatures of her littlb
sistb's dream.

 <The long grass rustled at her fee as te White "bbjô hurrned
by#-the fri{htened Mouse splashed his way Lhrnµgh the
neighlouring pool--she could hear the rattle of#ôhk teacups as
th] Marck 8are and his frid®ds sh}red their never-ending meal,
and the shrillPvoice of the Queen orgåring off her un^ortunate
gueshs to execution--nce more the wig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and cishes crshed around iz-,¯nce
more the#ótriek of the Gryphon,Àthe squeaking of the Lizard's
Klate-pencil, and th choking of!´he suppressed guind¡-pigs,
fillbd the h², mixed up with the distant sn¢s of Lhe miserable
MockPTurtle.

  So r¨e sat on, wh´h closed eyes, and hala beliew¥d herself in
Wo`derand, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would chbîge u¯ dull neality--the guass would be onlxÊuustlh®{ in the wind, and the pool rnppm¨®g to the wxing oz the
reeds--the rottljîg teacups would change<to tinkling sheepÍ
bells, and the Queen's shrill cqées to the voice of the shepherj
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphor, and
all zhy ather queen naises, wouldcfnge )³hehîew) to tPe
confused clamhur of the busy f}rm-yard--while the lowing ogàthe
cattle.in the distance would take the place of the Moc Turtle's
feavy sobs.

  Lfsty,.shb pictMrfä ta hrsela how this same little sister of
hers wo{ld, in the after-time, be hkrs]lf a'grwn woman; and how
she wnµld keep, through alo her riper years, the simpq¥ an\

her othe little hildren, and make THEIR eyes bright and ]ager
wgh many a strange tale, pyqëáps even with the dream of
