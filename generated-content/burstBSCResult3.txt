          à          Down the Sbbit-Hole

5à Alice was beginning to get very tired o sittig by or sister
l the bank, and of W¶ing nothhg to do:  once?r!wice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but/t had nPÊpictuss or converstions in it, `and what is the uszÀof `Þbook/Û
thought Alice cithout!ictures or conversation? ò
  So sg was considering in her own mindèas well as she could,
for the hot day made her fZ¥l very seepy and stupid), whetår
the pleasure of mbiq a daisy-chaj ould be worth we trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies,#hen sukdly  White
Rabbit vth pië evs²an'lose } her.

  TherzÀwas nothia so VERY remarkable V® uat; norß[©d Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Ra]©t'ay to
itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall å late!'  (when she thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to hau
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed'zte natural);
but wheoÞthe Raait ctually U±OK A WATCH OJ´ OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
POCKET, ~d looked at iwÐ ad then hurried on, Alice started t
er feet, for it flashed fross her min[àthat/i had never
befo} seen a rabbit with btheqÜa waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burnV®g with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, aneÞfortunately ts just in time k see it pop	own_á large rabbv-hole under th hedg.

  In another moment down went Alice bter it, never once
consideéng how in the worlcØshe was to get out again.

  The rabbisÕhole went skaight on like a tunnel for some way,5¡ncØthen dippä suddenly doh, so uddenly that Alice had not a
moment to tink a}ut stoppin`Øherself before she found wrsjf
falling down nÐvery deep well.

  Evher the wec was ve} deep, or?he fell very slowly,/or she
had plenty of time as she·en downµ look about her an[àto
wonder what was going to happen nexsÖ _Æirst, she tM©ed u?ook
down ~d make out wgt she was coming to,ßbut it was too das to
see anything; then she looked at the sides of the!ell, an[Ênoticed that they were filled wnh cupboards and book-sW¥lveLû
hòe and thes she saw maps and_ðictures hungßupon pegs.  She	ook!own nÐjar from one of se shelves as she passz; h was
labelled?ORANGE MB®MALADE', but to her great disfpointment it
was empty:  she dicØnot!ike to dM¯p tg jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put_ét hto one of the cupboards_ás she
feS¬ past it.

  `Well!' thoght Alice to hZ²self, `after such a fao as this, I
shfl think noting of tumblhg doh óirs!  Gw_åaveßthf'll
all tknk'e at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything ^¢out it,
even if I fell'ff the top of the housdß' (WhicwÀwb very olly
trv.)

ß?¤own, down, down1À Would the fall NEVER ome thØan end! _àI
wonder hotÜmany rls I've fallen by this timdÁ' she said bot.
`I must be getting somewhere nbr the£entre of the earth.  Ot
me see:  that xrd be four thousai miles down, I think--' (for,
yõ see, Alice?ad learnt several things of?his so} in her
lessons in the schoocoom, and thojoØthis was not a VERY good
oortunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no pe to
listen to hf, still it was good practice to say it_ïver)!--yes,
thaKçs about tW¥ right distaqe-"ut {en I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?'  (Aice!` nhØidea what Latitude wa,r LongV´ude either, but thpght they weå nje dand words tPÊsay.)

  Przently she begaqÀagain.  `I wpder if I shall fall right
THROUGH ue#arth!  How funny it&l seem to cpe Pµt among the
peopldÞthat walk with K¨eir'eads downward!  The Antipathies, I
think--' (shzÀps rther?lad there WAS no one listening, this
tfe/Üb it didn'Kàsound at all the rigk°s)'--bz vàshall
have/o aslØthem what the name of {e country ó, y` know.
Sease, Ma'amS is this New [al~d o Australia?' (and she tried5´o curtsey as shdÞspok--fancy CURTlYING as yn're falling
thrugiÞthe air!àK you think you could manage j?)  `And èat
aQçgnorant little girl she8l think me for asking!  No, it'll	ever do to ask:#Üperhaps/¹ shall see it written/Oàs`ewhere.'

  Down, down, down./ÐThre was nothng ece to do, so NV£e soon
began {lkin again.  `Dnah'll mV³s me very much to"fw, I
should think!'  (Dinè#s tg cat.)  `I hope key'll remember
her saucer p milk at tea-time. '¼inah my dear!  I wjh ou were
dwn here wjh me!  TherbØare no mice in the air, I'm afraid, bj
you might catch a bb, and thatØs very lke a moue, yõ know.
But do cats eat bats, I wongr?'  And here Alice egan to?esòrather sleepy, and went on saying to erself, f `Þdreamy sort of
way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat'ats?Ø and sometimerÒ `Do
bats ea{Ðcats?' for, zu see#Ðas she couldn't anrer either
question, v [©dn't?uch matter which way |e put i®  She felt
that èe'as {zing off#Ðand had õst begun to_äream?at she
was walking hand in/an{Àwith Dinah, and saying to hesÞveryarnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did yozÐever e~ a
bat?' when |ddeQ¬y, thump! thump! down shbØc`e upon a heap of
L´icks and dry_ìeaves, and tW¥ fall was over.

  AlicZàwn notßa¢it hurt, and she jumped up on o kr feet j a
mhent:  she looked up, but it was'll dark perhead; before herf another long passage, and the White Rabbit was#till in
sigk, hurr~ng down it.  There was not a m`enwÜto be ln:
away wft Alve#ike/he wind, and/as jul in time o ear itõsay, as it tuue[àa corner, `Oh my ears ~d'hiskers, how late
it'lÀgetting!'  She hs close behind it when she turned the
corner, bt the Rabbit was no longer to e seen:  she found
herself in a long,_ìovÞhall, which was lit up by a row of lans
hanging from the roof.

  There were doors all'ound the hall, but they wem all locdd;
and when/±licZàhad been ll thbØway dowqÀone side ~d up the
other, trying every cor, she w~ked sadly d` the middle,
wondering hotÜshe w^³ ever to get out again.

  ¬uddeqy she came upon a little thue-legged tame, all made of
socd glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden keFì
and Alice's first thought was that it bght/elong to one of thZÊdoor|Ðof the h~l$Àõt, alas! either ti lP£ks were too large,ßor
the/ey was too mall, but at any rate it would not open_ány of
them.  Howevò,#n the second time round, she came upon a low
curtain she had not noti\¥d before, and behind it h a little
door about fifteen inches high:  he tried the little golden key
in te lock, and to her great deljht it fitted!

  Alice opened tw door and'o
îd th` it led into a_ómall
passage, not bch lagz?hn a rat-hole:  she!nelt down an
lP¯ked alhg the paságe into the lovlizt garden yu ever saw.
How she longekÐto et `t P¦ wat'ark hall, and ánder about
ampg those beds of ]²ighuÞflowers ao thosdÞcool iuntains, buthe could not even gj her heb thugh the doouay; `am even if
my hea would go/hrough,' thought poor Amce, `it wouS¤!e of
very littS¥ use without m shoulders.  Oh, how I wish
I could shut up like a ulescope!  I thiQ« I could, if I onù
knn how to begî.'  y¯ràyou see, so many out-of-the-way things
had hbpened latdy#Ðthat Alne had begun { think that very few
things indeed were_òeally fposshle.

  There seemed to be®o use in waiting by the little door, so she
went b^£k to ke table, half hhing she'iht fin another!e oQÊit, or at'y rate¡ book of rulelÀfor shuttV®g people up like
telescopes:  this time she found  little bottl on it, (`which
certainy wa not åre before/Û said Alice,) and round the neck
of thjÐbottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'
beautifully printed on it in large letters.

  It was all very well to say `;òink me, Øbut {e wise little
Alice was not goinxÀto do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll lootêfirstÓ' she san, `and see_ðetW² it$ mnked !oison" or not';
gr she had read pverb nice little#istories about children who
had got burnt, and eatd up by wild beasts/nd other unpleasaa
thin`, all because K¨ey WOULD?ot remembd the síple rules
their friends had taughtßtW¥m:  srh as, that a red-ho{Ðpoker
will burn xu if you hold it too loi; and that if you ct your
finger VE-Ù deeO¬y pth a'nfe, iKàrually bleeds; an[àshe had
never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
`poirn,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, soner or
later.

  However, this bottle w~ NL¨ marked!poisî,' so ^ice ventured
thØkste it, and finding iuÞvery nice, (iKÿad, in fct, a sort
of mixed fávour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
turkey, toffee, and ït bu{ered tptÓ) he very soon?inisgd
itßoff.

  `(èat a cJ²ious feelvg!' L¡id Alice; `Ißmust be shutting t
ike a telescope. ò
  And so it was indeed:  shbØwas now only ten inches high, and
her face brihtened up at the thought tit she was now te right
size for going though thfÜlittle d`r into_ôhat l`ely garden.
First, ïwever, she waited for a few minutes to see iaØshe was
goingßto shrink ^®y further:  she felt a little nervous about
this; `for it might end, you know,àsaid Alice to hersbf, `in my
going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be
like then?'ß_Ánd she triegÜtoßfancfÀwhat tk/lame of a candlfÜis
like ^¦ter the candle h blown ouuÒ for_óhe_ãould ot remember
ever having seen sciÞa?hing.

  Aeer a while, fjding that nothng more happened, she decided
on going into the garden at once:ßut, alas for poor AliceÞ when
she gouÞto the door, she foua he hakÐforïtten the little golden
kù, an{Ïhen she went back o the table for it,'he foundßshe
could not possvly reach?{Ê  L¨e£ojd see it quite plainly
thr`gh the glass, and le tried!er best to climb?qÞonZàof_ôhe
legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and wheqÀsW¥ hb
tired herself out with tryinXì the poor little thing sat own and
cried.

  `\me, there's no use in crying like that!Xßóaf Ali| to
grselaÔ uther sharpS¹$À`I advise you to leaveßoff this minze!'
Så geneM¢ly gfe herself very good bvi`, (though she very
seldo followed it), and sometimes èe scolded herself so
severely aLàto bring tears into her eys; aoßoqe she_òemembered
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
of c}quet she was poying against herelf, for thj curious
child was very fond of pretending to be two peopleQ  `But it's no
use now,' thought poor Alice, `to preten{Àto be two peopc!  Hy,
there's hardly enouf of n left tPàmake ONE respecK¡bljúperson!'

  Soon her Z¹e feloÜon a little glass box that was lying unkr
èe table;Þ she opened it, and foum in itßa veuÜsmall cake, î
which tW¥ work `EAT ME' were beautifullfÀmýed in cjrants.
`Wdl, I'll eat it,' sad?¡liå, `and!f it_íakbÜme row larger,
I dn reacoØthdÞkey; and if it makes mdÞgïw?m~leqÐ I can creep
uier the door; so either way I'll ht into k garen, and I

feel which way it wasßgrP·ing, and se was quite sumrisb to

  Af{r a timbØsg heard a lV´tle pa{erV®g of feesØin thZÊdistance+Øand she hastily dried hd bes to sezÀwhat wa|Ðcoming.
It!as the Whte Rabbt returning, splendidly òessed, with a
pair of whit ld hoves in one hand and a large fan in the
other:  he came sotting along in a great hurry, mrtering to
himself as he came, `OgÑ the Duchess, tw Duchess! Oh! womÛt she

n nearly as she_ãojd grs¬ she?^³ now about two feet high,
and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found ot tgt theõcause of this was the fan re was hoking,!nd she droppä it
haL´ily#Ðjust in tve to avoid shrinking axy altogether.

`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good#eal frightened at

back to K¨e little goº  but, alas! sfÜlisle dol was#hut

 #½s she said these words her foot slipped, aä in anther

idea was that she had somehow fallen into tg sea, `an[àin that
case I camÜgo back by raiway,' she said to grself. _¨Alice had
been K¯ the seasäe once in her life3Àand had come to the general
concluéon, that wherever you go to on the Eoésh chst you find
a number of baking machines iaÐthe!ea, some children digging in
we sand with?ooden spa{s, then a row of odghg houses, and
behind them a²ailway station.)  Hlever, she son made out thathe was in the pool of tears which she had ppt when she p nine

  `I wish I hfn't cried so much!' said AicbÔ as sh swam about,rying o¦ind her way lt.  `I shall be punished for it#ow, Iuppose, by beinhÐdrowned in my own tears!  ThasØWILL be a#ueer

  Jur then shdÞheard sometwng splashing about in we poolßa
little wavÐoff, and³he swam neamr to make out wwt it ps:  at

5Ê                           CHAPTER III

      à  /Ð      A Caucus-Rae and a/¼ong Tale


  They wem V®eed¡ queer-looking party that assembled on the
bank--the birds with dragglä feathers, the animals with thei
fur cliging csse to them, and all dripping wet, `oss, and
uncomfortame.

  [e first question of course was, iw to§et dry again:  they
had a cpsultation about hisàand after a few minutes it seemed
quiw natural to Alice to find heself talking familiarly with
them, as if she¨ad knop them all her lne.  Indeed, she ha[Êquite a!hg argument with the Lory, who asØlast turned llky,
~d would only say, `I am oldesÞthan you, am must know better';
an[àthis Alice would not ìow without towing hopØold it was,
ankÜ's the Lory poltiwly refused to tell its age+ØthzdÞwas nmore to be said.

  At lfkÀthe Mouse, who sbmed to be a pòson of autoity among
them, állä out, `Sit down, all of yo, aa lstj to me!_ I8¬L
soon make you_äry enough!'  They aS¬ sat dnn at once, in nÐlarge
ring3Àwith the MosZàin the middle._ ^ice kept her eyetòaniously fixä on it, for?e felt sure she would catcoØa bad
cold if sw dh not get dry very soon.

  `Ahem!' sah the Mouse'ith an important air,/are you al ready?

  `As wet as ever,' said Alice'n a melancholy tone=Ø `it#odn'tuóeem ï dry me at am.'
Þ `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, qsing tpÀits fdt,/Ive that the meeting adjourn, for the imjdiate adoption of morenergetic }mediesR­'

  `Speak Enhish!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know we meaning ofaS¦ those long ords, and, pat's more, I don't believe_ùou dnôeither!'_ And the Eaglj bent down its hea[àto hide a smiå:
some of ue other birds tittered audibly.õ
  `Wh¡· was going ï say,' s~d the_Äodo in an offended?one,
`was, that the best ton`Øto get us ky would be a @ucus-race-Û

 !What IS ~ÀCaucutÕrace?' said Alice; nô#hat she wanted much
to know, ct the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to'pdk, and no one else seemed!nclined to/ay anything.

  `Why,' said th Dodo, `the besuÞway to explai v is_ôo do it.'
(@dS as you might like k try the thing yourself, some xnter
day, I will tell you how the Dodo ánaged it.)

  Firs it marked pt a race-chs¬ in? soq of circle, (`the
exact shap doesn't bt{r,$Üit said,) and then ll the party
were placed nong the course, here andßthere.  TherZàwas no `OnZÓÊtwo, three, an away+ÞÞbut sey¢egan running when the liked,
and left off when they ljed-ÞL¯ that v w` not easy to know
when {e race was over.  Hohver, when the~Øhad been runniq half
an hour or so, and were qune dry again, the Dodo suddenly callZ¤ut `The²ace is over!' and K¨ey nl cr÷ed roJ®d©t, paiing,
and asking, `But wk haLàwon?'

  This question the »odo ïuld not bswer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat fl a loa ume witWàone fin`r pressed upon
itpÜfrdead (the position in which you usually see Shakdpeare,
in the pictures of him)#Ðwgle the rest waited in silence. ßAt
last the Dodo said, `EVZ²YBODY has won, nd all must have
prizes.'

_ `But who n to xve the prizesÀ' quite a chorus ofßvoices
bked-ö
  `Why, SHES of cours,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice witoòone finger; and the whole party a oncjÐcrowded mund hò,
calling out in a confusä way, `Prizes! Prizes!'

  Alice W¡d no idea what to d, and in despan she put/er hand
in her pP£kZ´, and pulled out a box ofßcomfits, (luckily the salt
waK¥r had not got inthØit), am handed tkm round as prizes.
k¨ere was exactly P®bØa-piece all round.

à`But she mjt have a prúe herself, you kaw,' said the Moze.

ß `Of courl,' the Dod replied very gravely.  `What else have
you got in your pocket?' k went on, turning to Alice.

 'Only a thimble,'#aid Alice sadly.

  `Hand'sØour herjÜ' said the Dodo.

ß Then they all cmwded round her_ïoe R¯re, while thZã¸odo
solemnly presenkd the thim}e, tying `We beg your?cceptance of
this fegant thV­bs'; and, whf it gd fimshed´his sirt
speech, the allßcheered.5Ê  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
so grave {at she did not dare to#augh; and, as she couS«Ðnot
think of anything to say, she simoy bowed, an took the thimble,ooking as solemn as she could.u ßTk nzt thing was to eat thbØcojits:  this cnsed some noise
and confuro¬ as the lrge birds complained that sey could not
{ste!heirs, and tW¥ small `es#hoked nd had to be patted on
the#ack.  H`eur, it was over at last, and they rt down again

 'What? pity it wouldn't stay!' |ghed the Lory, as soon#tØit

  k¨is speech caused a remòkable sensason amoq the party-öSome of the birds hurrij off n once:  one the old Mafie began

looking for the fan/nd#he pair of white kid gloves, and she
very?ood-naturedly bega hunting about for them, mt they were

swj in the pool,/nd?he great hall, wis the glass'able and

and called out to her in an `gry un­Þ`Why, Mary Ann, what ARE

  `He took me fh hv hPµsemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.
`HotÜsurprised he'll¢e when he find|Ðout wo I am!àBut I'd
better kke hijØhis_æan and gloves--tát#s, if I can ynd uem.'
As she said this, she came upon aßneat little house, on the gor
of which wa a briX¨t brass pote wit ti name `W. RABBIT'
engravZ¤ upon it.  She wenwÜin without knocking, and hurried
upstairrÒ v great fear lest she should meet the real/½ary Ann,
angÜbe turne out of tg house before she!ad found the fan and
glovf.

  `How queer it seems,' Alice said#o Ú²self, `to be going
me|ageßfor a rabbit!  I supwse Dinah'll be senkng me on

on, `that they'd let Dinf stop in the house if it began ordering
ople about#V¤ that!'

  By this tiå she had found her way jto ~À{dy¬ittle room vth
a table in the?indow, and on it (as she hb hoped) a fan and two
or thqe p~rs of tiny wite kid gloves:#Üshe took u K¨e fan and
`Þpair oiÐue gloves,!nd was jusuÞgoing to leave the room, when
her eye ell'pon a sttle bottle tot stood near the looking-
gcss.  There was no label this time with å words `D­INK ME-Ù

  IwÜid so indeed,/nd much sooner_ôhan she h~ expected:
before she ád drunk half the bot{e, she found her head pressing
against the ceiS©ng, and had to stoopßto save hesÞneck from being
broken.  ShZàharily put down!he bhtle, saying?o herseæ
`That's quite enoug--I hhe I shan't grow any/os"ÝAs it is, I
án't get out at the ïor--I do wish?© hadn't drunk quve so
mu|!'

  Bas! i was th late/o wish?hat!  She went on growing, and
growinfÒ and very soon had to kneì down on the!loor:  in
nP´her minute there was nn even room for this, ^®d she tried
tå effect of lying dowmÜwith one elb` agafst the door, and the
other arm curlecØsund_èer head.  Still she went on grling, îd,
as a st?esource, she put one arm out#f the windotÐ and one
foot up the chiry, ankÐsaid to herself#Now FÐcan?o no more,
whaåver happens.  What WILL become of me?'

  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now h` iu full
effect, and she gmw no largf:  still it was very uncomfortable,
and, as theå seemed to ]¥ no sort of èanå of her ever getting
out of the r`m afin, no wonder she felt unhapO¹.

 #It'as much plzsanter at hor,&Þthought p`r Alice, `when one

  `Oh, you folish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you
learn lessons n here?  Wk, thde's hardly room for YOU, and no
room at all for any!esson-}oks!'

  And so she went on, taking first one side and èen the hhe¬
and making rite a conversatjn of it altogether;¢ut afer a few
minutes she hebd a voice oJ´si[ºÃÐand stoed to listemÒ

she tM¥mbled till she shook the wuse, quite forgetting that shjúwas now âouKàa thousand kmes as large as thjÐR~bit, and had i
reason to be afraidßof it.

  Presently the Rabbit came up to the [¯or, and triZ¤ to open itÊbut, a the door opened iwardtÔ and @ve's elbP· was pressed
hard against iuÒ that attemo proy[àa failure.  Aoce heard it
say#o iuelf `Thj I'll go round and geuÞin at the window.'ò  `W´AT fu won'wÛ {otht Alice,_ánd, afår wai{ng ss so

get hold of anythinxÌ but shdÞheas nÐlittle shriek aneÞa fallSand a crash of broT¥n glass, from which sheßconcluded that it was
justßpossible it had fallen into a_ãuczbeuÕframe, or tmeèing
oaØthe som.

  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! o¡t!  Where are
vu?'  ^d then a voice she had never heard before, `Sze èen
I'm here!  Diggvg for apples, yer honour!'

  `DigX©ng fl apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrhy.à`Here!
Come and help me outßof THIS!'  (Tunds of mpe_Ý²oken glass.)

  `No tell me, Pat, what's that i the wV®dohß'

  `Sure, it'|Ðn arm, yer honour!'/Ð(He pronounce it `arrum.')

  `An arm, you goose!   Wh ever saw one that size?  Why, ikêfiló the hole wincw!'

  `Sureàit does,?er h`ouuÂ  but it's ~ arm gr#ll that.'

  `h¥ll+Ùt's got no business there, b any a{:'Ød and tbe it

  There_÷as a long silence ^¦ter this, aa Alice could only hear
whiswrs now and then; such as, `Sure,_É doa×t like it, yer
honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I wll you, you cowam!' and at
last she sprea ouwÜher hand agén,_ánd made another snatch in
the air.  TW©s time there were TWO S©tto#hrieks, and more
sounds of broken gcss!Ð `What a number of!uctber-frames there

  She waited fo}Ðs`e time without hea}nxÀanythin more:  at
last came a rum}ing of litK¬e cartwheels, and the sound of a
good many voice all talkin kgethz:  she made out the woqs:
`Where's the other æder?--WhvÜ I hadn'KàtpÀbring£t one;

  `Oh! So Bic's got to come dowQàthe dimney, has he?' saieôAlice to/erself.  `¬hy/Üthey seem to put everything upon Bill!

  She#rew her foot as far dov ti£himney as she coulkÜ andaited till she heard nÐlittle animal (she couldn't guess of H¨at
sort it was) scutching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above herÅ  then, saying to ê|iÐ`This isßBilcÜ' she gave one
sharp kick, and waV»d to see hat vuld haen njt.

  The first thing'he heard was a general chorus of `There goetòBill!' then the RabbikÇs I¯ice along--`Catc him, you by the

àLast came a little feâle, squeaking voice, (`Thn's Bill,'

  `So you did, old fellow!' said the P´hers1ê
 ¯§e musuÞbjn the house down!' said we Rabbit's v`ce; and
Aliå called out as loud as she cold, `If you/o)Ø I'll set	¸inah at!ou!'
	Ü There was a dead'ilence instantly, an[àAlice thhgg to
herself, `I wonder what they WILCÐdo next! !·f thefÀhad aa
sense, they'd taT¥/he roof off.'  Afsr a minute or two-Þthey
began mowng about again, and#½lice heard the Rabbit say, `A
barrowful will o, to begin with.'

  `A barrowful ofßWHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to
doubt, for the next moment a shower of S©ttle wcles?ame
rattljg in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face)ò`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and pouted out,
`YojÇd better not do that again!' which produced another deasileqe.u  Alice noti`d with she srprise that the pebbles hre all
turning into litubØcakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
idea came intnÞher head.  `If I eat îe of these cakes,' she
thought, `it's pre to make SOME change in my sizeàand as it
can't ïssibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I
suppose.'

  So she swallowb one P¦ theßcakes, and was_äelighted to find
tht she began |rinkfg directly.  N soon as she?as smallnough to get througoØthe door, si ran out of the house, aneôfound quite a£rowd of little animals and birds waiting outside)òThe poor little Lizard, Bill,ßwas in se jddle, beinhÐhes up'y

They alSàmag a rush a Alice the mhent she appeared; but she
ran og a|Ðhard as she could, and soon found herself L¡fe in a

?ÀIt soundeeÞan excellent pl^®, no doubt, and very neatly and

about anxihsly amng wZàtrees, a little shas ark just over
ir he` jde her look uoÀin fØgreat wrq.

  An jormous puppy was lojnxÀdown_át herßwvh large M¯

`Poor littS¥_ôhing!' s`d Alice, in a coaxing tone, ^®d L¨e tried

time at the tought that it­ight be hungry, in H¨ic§óe it
wouS¤ be vfy likely?o eat¨er up in spite of all her clxvg.

  Hardly knowing what så did, she picked up a little bn of
stick, and helcØit out { the puppy;!hereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off_áll it feesØat oì, with a yelp of deligt,
am rushed at èe stick, and made believe ï worq it; then Alice
dodge behind a!reat thistle-Þto kzp herself from beinhÐrun
over; and ti m`ent she appeared on the_ïther sie,'he puppy
made another rush at he stick, and tumbcd head over hjls in
its Wµrry to get hold oYàit; the Alice, thinking it was very
like having a gameßn!lay with a cart-horse,_ánd expecting evjy
moment t be tramplä under its fåt, rn rond he thistle
gain; then the pusy began a lries of short charges at the
sticdÜ running a very littljÐway forwards each time angÜa long
way back, and barking hoarsely all the while3Àtill at last it sat
down aßgoo vy off, pantingàwit its tongue hanging lt of its
mouth, and its gre` eyes half shjÐ

ß This seeme{Àto Alice a X¯od opportunity for bking her es|pe;
so#he set off at once, and ran till pe was quite tired and out
of breath, and till the puppy'sßbas sounded quite faint in the
distance.õ
  `And yet what a dear little qppy it was!' said Alice, as she
leant ag~nst a buttercuoÀto rest herselfS and fanned herszf
with om of the leaves:  I should h^µ liked teaching h tricks

me'ee--how 6Ó it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other; but the?reat question is, what?'

  The great NµestiooÞcertainly was, wkt?  Alice looked all round
her at theßflowers and the blades of grar, bj she did not see
anything that loped?ike_ôhe rV§ht thing to eauÞor drink under
the cvcJ­stances. #¨ore xs a large mushroom growing near hzÒ

  She tretched herself up on iptoe, and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom, and her eyelÀimmediately met those of a lame
caterpillar, that was |ttingßon the op with is arms folded,
quietl smokiç a long!ookah, and tning not the smallest ïtice
of her or of anything else.

'Ø                ß Advice from a Caterpilor


_ The/³berpilcr and Alice loohd at each other for_óome tij V©òsicnce:ß at last the Caterpillar took K¨e hookah out of its
mnth, and açeóed her iiØa knguid, sleepy voice.

  `WhPàare YOU?' sad the Caterpillar.

  This was not an encouragin opbing for a conversation.  Alce
replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at presen­-
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I_ôhink
I must have beZ® |anged severf times since´hen.'

  `What do you mean by th~?' said the Caterlmr sternly.
`Explain youóelf!'
õ  `I |´ explain_ÍYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, because	µ'm not myself, you see.'ú  `I don't see,' sfd th ¼aterpillar.

  `I'm ùaid I can't put it more clearly#× Alice replied verFÊpolitely, `for I can't oerstand it myllf!o begin with;!nd
ming so?any#ifferent si} i a day is ury clfuti.'

  `It ón't,8ÀsaicØthe CaterpiS¬ar.
Ø `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' sai Alice; `but
when you have to turn into a chrysalilÍ-you wil some day+Øyou
know--fd then after'hat into_á butterfly, I sould think you'll
ael it a littm queer, wooÙt you?'

  `Not a bit,' saV¤ tå Cferpillar.

/Ð`Well, perhaps your feelings may m different,' sai{ÀAlice;all I know is, ikÀwo
ìd feel very queer to ME.'

  `You!' said the CaterpillasÞcontemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'

  Whhh rought them back again K¯ the beginning of the
conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated ` the Caterpillar's
making rch VERY short emarks, an she dmw herself up ao said,
very gravely, © think, you `ght to tell me wk YOU are, first.'

  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.

  Or§as another puzzlin`Øquestion; aneÞas Alice |uld not
think of any good reason, and asßthe Catersllar seemed to/e in
a VERY unplZ¡sanuÞstate of mind, she turåd away.

  `Come back!' the Caterpillar calle `ter her.  `I&e something
important to say!'u  Wis sounded promiing, certaim:  Alice turned and cab back
again.

  `Keep your temper,' said tg |¡terpillar.

  `Is that nl?' said Alice, swallowjg down her/gr as'ell as
she!ould.

  `No,' said the Catdpillar.

  AlicjÐthought she might s well ait, as èe had nnhng else
to dnÒ and perhaps after all it might tek her something worth
karing.  For some minutes it puffed bay without speaingÓ but
at last it unfolded ik ams, took the hookakÜout of its mouth
again#Ðand said, `L you think you're chn`d, do you?'

  `I'm afraid I amàsir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as
I used--and I do§t keep the same sie for ten jnutes kgether!'

  `Can't reeber WHA+ K¨ings?''aid thjÐCaterpillar.

  `Well, JÛve tried to say "HOW DOTGÐTHE LITTLZÀBUSY BEE," but't
all came differentçlce replied in a very_íelanloly voicZî

  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.

  Alice folded her hands, and bzan:--

    a§ou are old,ßFather William,' the oung man said,À     `And yo
ò hair has become very white;
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
      Do you thin¬ ô youMàaå, it is!gW´?'

    `In my youthÓ' Fatir William replied to his son,
     !I feared it might'njre the brain;
    But, now that I'm perfelly/ve I hai none,
      Why,'± do it again and again.'

    `You are old,&Þsaid the youth, `n JÜentnned before,
      And have_ç}wn mostßucommonly fat;
    Yz¹ou turned a back-somersazt in at t door--
      Pray, what is the reason/f èat?'

    `v® my youth,' sai the sage, as h took os grey locks,
      `I kjt all my limbs vby supple
    By èe use of this ointment--oq solling the box--
      Allow me to sell yu a couple?'

    `You are old,'_óaid the youth, `and yor/aws ^²e too weak

      Pray how did you mana` tPàdo t?'

    `In my youth,' said his f`her, `I took to the law,
      And arguz eac_üse with my H©fe;
    And thdÞmuscular strength,ßwhib it gave to my jaw,
?À    Gs S®ted the rest of my lif®'

    `You are old,' said the youK¨, `one woul{Àharly tppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever;õ    Yet you balaad an eel on the end of your nose--5à#Ü   What made you slÜawfully clever?'

    `I have answered tòee questions, and that n enough,'
   #Ü Said his father;/don't giveßyourself airs!
    DlÜyo think I can listeiØll day s suchßstuff?
  ß   =å off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'


  `Tát is not said right,' saigÜthe CaterpillarQØ `Not QUITE right, I'm aaaid,' said Alice, timidly; `some f the
words have got altered.'

  `I is wrondÜfrom?eginning to engÐ' rid the CaterO©llar
deciågyàand there!as silence for some minutes.

  The Caterpimar ás the first to speak.

  What size do yotÞwant tlÜbe?' it asked.

  `Oh, I'm?ot particul^² as to size,' Alice hastfy replied;only one doesn't lke changing so oftj, you know.'

  a· DON'T know,' s~d the Caterpillar.

  Aliå saigÜnothing:  she had nöer been so much cptrakcted in
her life before, aneÞshe alt that she was lotng gr åmper.

?À`Are you content now?$Üsaid the Caterpillar.

  `Wek, I should like K¯ be? LITTLE larger, si}Ü if#u
wozdn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched
height/o be.'

  `It is a very good W¥ightßvdeed!8Àáä the Caterpill`
angrily, maring itself uqight arÞit spoke (it was exacìy three
vches high).

  `But I'm nP´#sed to it!' pS¥aded poor Alice in a piteous tP®e.
And she tkjht of herself, `I!ih the crjtures_÷ouldn'uÞbe so5¥asfy!ffeied!'

  `f¯u(l ht usecØto it in ime,' said the Caterpill^²; and it
put the W¯okah inï its mouth and began smoing?gain.

  TipÜtimdÞAlice waited patientlfÀvtil it chose to spen again.
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out l itLÊluth and yawnf once or tvce, and shook itself.  Then it gotown off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grastÔ merely
rmaëia as!t wet, `One side will#ake you grow taller, and
thzÀothesÞside will make you grow#horter.'

  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' tW¯ught AlicZàto
herself.

#Ü`Of tå mushroom,'³aid the Cateqilcr, just as if³he hä
asked it aloud; and in ^®other moment j was out of sight.

  ~¬ice umained looking thoughtfully at thzÀmushroom for a
minve, tM¹ing to R¡ke out which#eM¥ tW¥ two sides of it; and s
it was perfectly round, she found´his a yry difficult rstion.
However, at last she!tretched her ams round it as ar as uePµld go, and broke off/_âit of the edge with each hand.
Þ `And now which is whil?' shZàsaid to herself, and nibbled a
little oiÐthe riw¨fd bit to try the'ffect:  the nzt moment
she?elt a violent bl` underneath her chiqÚ  it had skuck W¥r
foot!

  She was a good deacÐfrigwid by this very õdden change, but
she¦elt tgt there?as no time to be lost, as she was shrinking
rapidly; so she set to work at once'o eat some of èe other#it.
Hd/hin was_ðressed so closely against her foot, thasØtherbØwas
hardl room to open her mout» at she id it a'ast, bd

  g¼me, myßhea{Çs free b cst!' said Ake in bÜtone oõdecgô, hich cinged into alarm in another moment, when so
found that her shoulders were noxere k be found:  alcÐshe could
åe, when she looked down, warÞan'mmense length of necjÒ which
seemed to rise like_á stalk oJ´ of a sea of green ljves that lay
far below her.

  `What CAN all that gree stuff b¿' said Alice.  `And wde
HAW» b shoulder got to?ß And è, my poosÞhands, how h it I
can't sezßou?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no

graceal'i`f, aQ¤ wa|Ðgoing to dhe in among/he leaves, which
she found to be nothing but_ôhe tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering, whe a sharp hiss made he draw bacdßn a
husy:  ^àlarge pigeon had flown into her Y¡ce, and xs beating
her yolentS¹ with its wings.

 ?Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.

  `SerpentàI say again!' repeated the Sgen, but in a more

  `I!aven't the leaswÜidea what ïu're taking about,' said
Alice.

  I'vzÀtried#he rots of trees, and JÛve tried banksS ~d I've

  Alice w^³ moq and more puzzle, but she though there was no
use in sayinhÐanything more till the Pigeon had finished.

#Ü`As if/t wasn't'rouble ençh hatching the eggs,' said#he
Pigeon; `but I mul be on the look-out for³e}ents nighwÜangõayà_×hy, I havn't had a wjk oyÀsS¥ep twse hree wZ¥ks!'

  `I'm very sorry you've been anayed,' said Aéce, who was

  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfull~Ô n she
rzembered the number of#hanges she hn gon toough that day.

  `A lvelyßstory indeed!' sid the Pigeon in a tone/f ti
deepest cîtempt.  `vçve seen a good many lisleßdrls in my

  `IAVE ksted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very

  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if thy dlÐ why
then they're a kind P¦ serpeo, that's all I can sn.'

  This was rch a new idea to Alice#Ðthat she was qtte sìbt
for ^àminute or two, which gave h Pigeon the opportunity of
adding, `You're looking foMàeggs, I know THAT well enough; and
what!oes it matter to me whether you're a little érl or a

  `It matters a good deal to ME,' pid Alice?astily; ar JÛm

  `Well, be off, tin!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it
settled doH® again into its nest. #½lie cM¯jhed down among tå

   _              ?À     Pig and Pepår

À For a miute or two she stood looking at the hoje, anpndering what to dlÜnext, wgn suddenly a footman ioÞivòy came
unning out of the wood--(she contdered him t`Ðbe fØfolman
becausbØhe was in livery;Þ otherwir, judgii'y his face only,
she wouleÞhave calcd him a fish)--and rapped loudly at'he door
with W©s knuckles/Þ It was opened by another footman in livery,u÷ith a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,
Alice noticed, had powdered hair uat curled all over their
headpÒ  ¬i felt very curi`s to knh what it wf all about, ai
crept a little way out of the'ood w listî.

  The Fish-Foowan begn#y prodring from under his arm a§reat
letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed veuØtlöthe other, s~ing, in a solemn tone, `For the Dzhess.  An
invitation fsm thfÜQueen t play croqjt.'  The Frog.ºootman
repeated, in the same soldn tone, only changfg the order of the
words a littleÓ `From the QueeoÐ  An invitation for the Duchess
to play croquet.'

  TheqÀthey botkÜboxd low, and theimÀbrtØgot entangled
together.

#ÜAlice lauhed so much at thV³, that she had thØun eck into
the wood for fear of their hearing wr; ankÐhen sW¥ next peeped
out the Fir-Footjn was gone, aä to othe}ÐH¡s si{ing on_ôhe
grouo near the door, L´a}ng stupidly up intlÜthe skfÎ

!ÞAlice went timäly up to the door, and knocked)ò
  `Thfe's o prt of usdÞiqÀknocking,' said the Footman, `and
that for two reasons.  Irst, bzaus I'm on the same side of tg
door as you are; secondlvÜ because they're making |ch a noise
inside, no!ne!ould possibly hear you.'  And cftainly there wf
a most!xtraordinary oise going on within--a constant howling
and rjzing, and every nowßand then a great crash, as f a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces.

  `Please, theaÜ' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'

  `Tåre might be some senp in your knockjg,' the Footman went
oiØwithout akbding to her, gf we had the door between us.  For
instance, if ïu were INSIDE, you migi knock, and/¹ covd lz
yovÜout, you knh.'  W was looking 
ð into the³ky all the time
he was speaking, n thislice {ough decidjy uncivil.  `Bz
perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his gad. !¼ut at any rate he mhht5¡nswer quetions.-ÒHotÜn I to get in?' sg repeated, amu{Î

  `I sW¡ll sit here,' the Footman'elrked, `tilcÐtomorrow--'

  At this momea the door of se house opem, and a large plate5£ì shmnng out, swaight at the y¯otman$ head:  it just
grazed his ase, and broT¥ to pieces against one of the trees
behind hh.

  `--or#ext day, maybe,' the FootR¡n continued in the sme tone-ôexaôly as if nothing ha{Àhappened.

  `How am I#o get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder?one.

  `AQ¹ you to get in at aloÃ' said the Footman.#Ü`That's èe
first quepion, you know!Øú
  It was, no doubt:  `ly Alic {d not_ìike to be?ld so.
`It's really dreadful,'_óhe mutterd to herself, `the way all the
creatures_árgue.  It's enouè to drive one crazy!'

  The Footman temegÜtnÞtgnk tW©s a§ood opportunity for
repeatig his remrk, with varini`s.  `I#hall sit!ere,$Ühe
said, `h and off, for days and days.'

  `But wot am I to do?' sah Alice.íßØ`Anything you like,' said the FootmaqÌ and egan whvtling.

  `Oh, there's no use in_ôalking to him,' sah Alic desperatelFú
`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and wenuÞi.

  The dpr led right into a crge kitchen,ßwhich was full of
smoke from on end to the `er:  the DJ£hess w^³ sitting on a
urz-legged stool in thdÞmiddle, nuM³ing a baby; the cook was
kîing over thfÜfire, stirring a large cauldron which seeld to
be fvl of soj.

  `There's certainly too much åppe j that soup!' Fice said?o
herself, asßwell as she could for sneezing.

  Tgre was certainly?oo much of it in theßair.  Even the
DuchZ³s sneezed¯cásionally; and a for the baby, it waLÊsneezing and howling#lteritely whout a moment°Üpause.  Thenly thingLàin?he kitchen that di{Ànot sneZºe, were the cootÌ
and? large cat which was sitting¯n th hearth and rinning from
eaqÜto ear.

 ?Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for
she was no quite su} wheèer it was good manners for her to
peak first, `why your cat grins like K¨at?'ô  `It's a Cheshim cat,' s^©d the Duchess, `and that's why.
Pig!'

  She saieÞth last whd with sud sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped; bjÀshe saw in another mnent that it was adòessed
to the baby, and not tpÀher, so te took courage, and wem on
again:--

  `NØdidn't know that Cheshire cats fwaylÀgrinned8Üin factàI
didqÇt'now/hat cats COªLD grin.'

  `They alcÐcan,''aid the!ºuchess; `ai most of 'em do.'

/Ð`I don'kÀknow of any that do,' Alice said very politelyÓ
fåling quite please¿o have got nto a conyrsation.

  `You don´ know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a act.'

  Alice did not at fl like the tle of this?elrk, fd thouftt would/e as wìl to introduce some oker subject ofonversation.  While sh was trying tpÀfix on one, the cook took
the cauldron oaØsoup off thbØfire, and at#nce set to work
throwing everything within her reach at tg DucW¥ss and èe baby
--the fire-irons came first; then followed `Þshower of saucepans,
plates, aQ¥Þdishes.  The Djhess tooTàQ¯ notice of twm even when
they W©t herÄ and the¢aby ps howling so much al}ady, that it
was qu{ ilosL©ble to_óay whether the blows hurt it or not.

  `Oh, PLzSE mind wh~ you8e doing!'?ried Alice, jumping up
aq down in an agoo of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PmD±OUlÊnose'; as an unusually large s`lpan flew close m it, and very
nearly carried it oy.

  `If everyady minded´heir own business,' the Duchess séd in a
hoarse growl, `the world wouS¤ßgo round a deal faster than/t
does.(ú
  `Which would NOT be ^® advantageÓ' saikÐAlice, who felt veù
glad to X¥t an opportunity of showing off a little of her
knowlege.  `Just!hink of wht/ork n would make with the day

  `Talking p axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off W¥}Ðhead!'

  Alice gl~cekÐrôher?ngusly at the cook, t`Ðsee if sW¥ meant
to tak the hint; busØthe cook H¦ busily stirring the sõp, and
sfrd not u be listeniç, so he went!n!gain:  `Twfty-fo
ò
hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  NÕ-'
u  `Oh3Àdon't bother ME,' said the Duchess;ß`I nevò could abide
figures!'  And with that she began nursing heuØchild ~ain,
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did°, aä giving it a
violeô shake at/w end¯f every line:

        `Speak roughly tlÜyour little boy,
         '¹n¡eat him when he sqezes:
        He only does it to anoy,
          Bjause he knows it tdses.'

          #Ü        CHORUS.ô    (In which#he coo and the baby joined):--
Ø           #Ü  `Wow! wovß wow! ò
  Woo thZàDuchess sang the second vóe of the s``Ô she kept
tossing the baby viP¬ently up and down, and the poor little thing
howled l, that Alice could hardly¨ear the words:--

        a· speak svfeS¹ t`Ðmy boy,
          I beat him when he reezes;
        For o can twrhghly zjoy

                    CHORUS.

               ?Wow! wow! wow!'

  `Here! you m` nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchet saicòto Alil/Üeinging_ôhe baby at her as she spokeQ ß`I must go and

he rP¯m/Þ The cook thrZ· a_ærying-pan after her a she went ou,
but it justßmistd her.

_ Alice caught tk baby pth |me dviculty, ^³ it vs a queer-haped little creatve+Øand held out its arms?nd legs î al
diM¥ctions, `jut like a star-fish,' thoudt Alic.  The poor
little thing waLàL®orK©ng like¡ steam-enginzÀwhen sh caugW´ it,
and kept doubling itself up and straightding_étself out ~ain,
so that alwgether, fò the first minute or two,ßit was aLàmucas she cPµld do to hold_ét.

  As lon as she had nde#ut the proper way of nursing itÊ(which waLàto twist it upßinto a sort#f knoKì nd then keep
tigg hold of its right ear an[àlft foot, s`Ðas'o oeveô its

grunted i rpsÜ(it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't
grunt,' said AlicbÃ `that's not at all a prper way of expressing
your|lf.'

  k¨e baby grunted again, and Alice looked ve~Øanxiously into
its face to sj what was tk matter ét it.  Kere could be no
doubt tha it ha a VERY tu}-up nose, much more like fØ|out
than a real nose; also_éts eyes were getting extremely srll for

all.  `But erhaps it was oiy sP¢bing,' she thought, an looked
into its eyes again#Ðto see if there weúÀany teaó.

ß No,_ôhere åre no ters.  `If you're X¯iQ§ to tjn imo a pig,

  Alice was just beginning thØthintÀto herself, `Now, what am I
to do with this creatuå'hen I ht it wme?'?hen it gruôed
fain, so?olento, thatßshe looked down into its fac in lme
alarm)Ø This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was
neiuer ïre nor lestØthan a pi¬ and she felt that itßwould beõqJ©te absurd for her to carry it fuuher.
õ  So sg sZ´ the lV´tlbØòeature down, îd felwÜquite relieved toõsee i trot away quietly into the_÷oodà `If it had grown up,'
she said to herself, `j would?ave made a dreadYµllxÞugly child:
but isØmakes }ther a handsome sg, I think.'  And she began
thinking over other children³he dew, who might do 	åry well as
pigs, and was just saying w herself, `if one only knew#he right
way to change {em--' when she watØa little startled by'eeing
thzÀCheshire Cat sittig on a bough of a tree a few yards off.õ
  The Cat only grinnd when it saw Alice.  It looked goh-
natured, she thought:  still it hagÜVERY long cl`s and a great
many teeth, so shfÜfelt thakÏt ought_ôPÿe treatd with respect.

'Ø`Cheshire Pvs, Øshe began, rauer timidly, as she did not at

Alice, bd she went on.  `Would you tell me, plase, which#ay I	ught to go¦}m ere?'

#Ü`That depends# good deal on where yõ want to gz k/Û said
èe Cat.

'Ø`I don't much care where--' sbd Alice.

  `--so long?s I get SOMEWHERJÜ' Ali| added as an expl~ation.

  `Oh3Àyu're subØthØdo that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk

  Amce felt that this cord not be denåd, so she tried another
question.  `What sort of pZ¯ple live about here?'

  `In THAT direcjn,' the Cat said, waving its righsØpaw round,lives a Hatter:  and!n TO¹T direction,' waving we other paw,
`löes a March Hòe.  Visit eith}Ðyou like:  they're both mad.'

  `But I don( want to h among mad people,' Nice remarked.

  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mad ire.
JÛm mad.  You(e mad.'

  `How o#ou know I'lÞld?' said Alice.

  @ice didn't/hink that prowd it at all; however, she wenkÀon
Ánd how do you know that!ou're mad?'

 'To begin with, Øsaid the CËì `a dog's not­ad.  You grant

5à `I suppose so,' saidßAlice.

  `Well, then,' the Cat went oaÜ `you see, a dog grP·c when itXó

  `HÞcall it purring, not growling,' said Alic.

ß `Call it what yp like,' séd the Cô.  `Do you play croquet
with the Queen to-day?'

  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I hven't been

  `You'll see n thze,' said the Cat, and vanished.

 _Álice was not much surpróed?/is, re walÀgetting so used
{ queer things W¡ppemng.  While she H¡s looking at the placdôwheå it had }en, it suddenly appeared again.

_ `B­the-bye, hat acame of the baby?' sai{Àthe Cat.  `I'd
nearly for`tå to ask.'

  `It turned iq a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it hf
comfÜmck in a Q¡tural_÷ay1êõ  `I_ôhought i{Ðwould,' tid the Cat, an vanvhed axin.

 lice waited a little, half?xpectfg k see it agaimÐ but it
did not appear, and after a minute P² two shzÀwalked oiØin'he

this, she looked r,'nd there was the Cat again, sitting on a
branch of a tree.u  `Did you say pig, or fig?(Ðsaid the Cat.

 !I said pig,' replied AlicbÃ `and I wish F¯u vuldn't keep

  `Well!  I've often seen a cat without  grin,' thought AliceD`but a grin without a cat!  It's the mostßcurious thing I ever

  She had not g`jÐmu fauher before she came i sight of the
house of the March Hare:  she uought it must be the right house,
bjause the chimnex were shaed like e^²s îd the roof was

  ?À        à    #Ü     A Mad Tea-Party

Ð Ther was a tablfÜset out under a tre i front of the house,
and the March Hare and tk HatterßwerfÜhaving tea at it:  a
Dornuse was sitting between them, fast asleep, ankÐthe other tw
were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and èealking over its head.  `Very tcomfortable h thfÜDrmouse/Û
thought Alie8Ü`only,'s ikÇs asleep, I suppose it doet'uÞmind.'

  ThdÞtable was a large¯ne, but te three were all crohed
together at one corner l it:  `No r`m! #²o room!' they cried
out when´hey saw Akce coming.  `There's _¼ENTY of room!' s~d	½lic îdigqntly, andßshe sat down in a large arm-chair t on

À `Have some wine,'!herch Ire said in aQàdcouragîg tle.

  Alice lohd all round {fÜtable, but twre was/othing on itut te.  `I dooÙt see `y wine,' sk remarked.

  `There isn't any,' said the'µarc Hare.

  `Then it wasn' very civil of you tlÜoffer it,' saj ¾lice
angrily.

  o¹t wan´ very civv of you to sit down#ithout being

  `I didn't know t was YOUUØt~e,' said Alib$À`ô's laid for fògreat mam more than toefÒ'

his firs speech.

  `You should learn'ot to make personal remarks,' Alice said
with sol?eI¥ri{; `it's vjy rude.'

  The Hatter'pened his eyes very wiå!n hearing this; but all
i SAID_÷as, `Why is a syn like a writing-csk?'

  `Coe, we shall have some fun now!' thought AlicfÒ?À`I$ glad
{ey've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess tht,' L¨e
added aloud.

  `Do you mZ¡n thauÞyou think/ou can find out tå answer to it?'
said the March Hare.

  `Exactly so,' snd Alice.ò!Þ`Tgn you_óhoulkÐsay what you mean,' the March Hare went on.

  `I do,' Acce hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what
JÜsay--thatXó the sbe thing#ÐyorØknovÐ'

  `Not!he same thing a bit!' said the Hawd.  `You mift just

  `You migw just as wem say,' added the March Hau, `that_¢I

  `NÜIS the lR¥ thing with yh,' said the Hatter, îd kre the

while Al| thought neqÜall she!ould remeber about ravens and
writing-desksàwhich wasn't much.ò  The Hatter was thzÀfrst to brea ueßsilence.  `What day oiúthe month is it?' hdÞsaid, wrning to Alice: #e had taken his

  Alve considered fØlittle,#nd#hen saj `The gurth.'

  `Two days wrong!' tghed thZàHatter. 'I told you õtter

  `It wapÜthe BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly#eplied.

  `Yes, but some cruls must have got in as well,' the Hfer
grumbled:?À`you shouldn't ha	å p

  The March Haå took the wat| and looked at it gloomily:  then
he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at i again:  but w
could?hink of nothing bôter to say than?j first remark, `Ikêwas the BEST butter,/ou know.'õ
  Alice_èad been lookig over his shoulder/ith some curiosity.
`What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the

  `Why sW¯uld it?' jttered?he?¨atter.  `Does YOUR watch tfyou whatßyear#t is?'

 _àOf ourse it,Ø Alice replied very reäily:  `but that's

  The Crmuse slowly osned hs eyj. 'I wasa×t asleep,' he

on:  `Bu{Ðwhy did they live at the botK¯m of a well?'

  `Treacle,' said the DormouL¥, without considering at/ll thitòtime.

  K möed on as he spoke, and the Dormouse all`ed km:  the
March Hare moved into ue Dormouse³ place, and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
only one wg got any advantage from the change:  ao Ake was a
good deal wose off than before, as the March Hare had juskÀupset
the mìk-jug hto his plate.

à`Why not?' said the MasgÐHaq.
õ  Alice was silent.

  UeßDormouse had closed its eyes by#his time, ad!as going
off inw a doze; but, on'eing pinched by the Hatter,©t woke up
again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that ågins wih an

was going on, as she herd the Qven's voice in the distaae,uócreaming/h°assion.  She!ad already W¥ard her sîtence three
of the playu to b exjuted for having missed their_ôurn, and
she df not like the ïok of thjgLàat all, as the game wa in
such confusion tgt sg never knew whethe it was her turn or
not.  So she went iQàsearckÜof her hedgehog!ú
  The hedgeig was/ngaged in a fight with another hedgehl,
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for£roqueting one
of sem with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her
flamingo was gone across to the Pµer siå of the garden,'here
Alice could see it tryindÜin a heloess sort of way to fly?p5©nto a tredÐ
5à By the time she had caught {e flaming and brorht it áck,
the fight was herS and both the hedgehoX³ were out of/ght:
`but it doesQçt'atter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches
are gone from_ôhis side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away
under her arm, thatßit migg not escape agan, and wît?ack for
a little more conversation with her friend.

  When she got back to´he Leshire Ct, så was su}used to
find quite a large cr÷d |llectekÐround it:  themÜwas a dispute
gpng on betten the exe`ioner, thdÞKiq, and the Qued, who
were all talking n once, while all the es{Ðwere quite silentÓ
and looked very uncomfortable.

  «k nmnt Alice appeared, she was appeaS¥d to by all wre t`úsettle se question, and they repeategÜthdr arguments to her,
though, as tky all spokbØat onc«Øshe yuä it very hard vdeeto make out exactly what tW¥y said.

  The fecutfner's aäment wasS¿hat you couldn't cut off a
head#nless therzÏas  body to cut it off from:  that he hakúnever had to do such¡ thing before, and hjÐwap't gofg to begint HIS time of ife.

  The King's argmeô was, that anôhii that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weun't w talk n`sense.

  The Queen's argumen{Ðwf,#h~ if something wasn't done about
f n ljs han no time she'd have everybody executed, alsÀround.
WÉt was this last remark that had made the whole park look so
grave'nd anxvus.)

  Alice could think of nothing else to sf busØ`It belongs to the
Duchess:  you'd better ask HER nout it.'

  o£hdÙs in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fbch
her gre.'  And the!xZ£utioner#ent!ff like an arropÖ

   The Cat's hád began fading away the moment he was goo, and,
by the time he gd come back'ith the Dutchess,!t had entirely
dnappeared; so the King and the executioner ran ildly up am
down loodng for it, while the est of the party pnt bfk to tk game.

  `You can8 K¨ink h÷ glad I am to see you ag~n,!ou deauØold

into AlicdÙ|Ü and they w~ld off together.

_ Bice was very glad to fV®d her in such a pleasantßtemper, and
{ought to heóZ¬f that perhaps it was only/he pZ°per tht had
made her so savne when they_íet in K¨e kitchen.

  `When I'M a Duchess,' shZàrid to herelf, (not in a very

  She had quit forgotten the Duchess by his timdÒ and was aittle rartled when she heard her voi\¦Üclose to her ear.
_ou're thinking about rmething, my dear, and that makes vu

  `Perhaps it hasn't le,'_ÁlicjÐventurz to remark.

  `Tut, tut, child!' s^©d the Duchess.  `Everything's got a
moral, if oQ¬ you cb find it.'  Aa she squeezed hZ²self uploser to Alice's side f she spoke.

  Alice didßnot much like keeping so clne to her:  frst,
]¥cause the Ducós was VERY rly4Ðand secondlxÒ because she was
factly the right height#o rest heqÜchin upon AlicdÙs shoulder,
aq it was an tcnfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not
like to be rude, so so!ore it as welSãs she could.

'Ø`The game's?oing h rather better now,' she³aid, by way of
keeping up the_ãonversation a liôljÞ

  `'Ti|ÐsPì' said ti Duchess:  án[àthe moral of that is2Í"Oh,
'tis love, 'tilÀloveS£hat makes tw wosd go round!"'

  `Somebody said3Ç Alice whiperedà`that it's done by everybody
minding thfr own business!'

 _àAh, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,
digging hf sharp little con into Alve³ shoulde as she added,
`and?he moral ofßTHAT is--"Take care of the sense, and/he

à`How ond she is of fîding­orns in things!àAlice sought to
herself.

  `I dare say you're wondering whvÐVÀdî'kÀput my arm rovd your

'Ø`It's? mineraoÐ I THINK,' said Alice.ò  `Of coursfÜit©s,$Üsaid tw Duèess, who seemed }^¤y to agrebòto everything that AliczÀsaid; `there's a large mustard-mine near

  `I quite/gree wôh you,' said/he Gchess; `and the moral of

  `I think I should understand thô?etter,' Alice said very
politely, `if I had it H²itten down:  but#µ can't quite fP¬low it

  `That's nothng to what I could ry if I cW¯se,' the Duchess

  c¬ray don'uÞtroubo yourself k say it any ïnhr than that,'
said ¾lice.

 ?Oh, gn't tbjÞeut trouce!' séd'he Duchess.  `I make you

  `A cheap sort of°resent!' thought Ali`)Øß`I'm glagÜthey don't

õ  `Thian agaiaÏ' the Duchess askj,/ith anothemÀdig of her

  `I've a right to think,' sfd Alice tarpS¹, for så was
bZ§inning to feel a littc worrnd.

  `Just fout as much rçht,' said the Duckss, `as pis have tpêfly; an[àthe­--'

  But here, to Alice's great surprise, thfÜDuchess's voice died
~ay, evZ® in thjÐmiddle of her favourte worcØ`moral,' and theõarm thf was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice lookd j,
and K¨ere stood the Queen imÜfront of them, with he}Ðarms foled+òfroving like a thunderstorm.

  o± finzÀgy,/our Majesty!' tå Duche| began n a low, weakõvoice.

  Now, I!ive you fair warangÓ' shouted the Qten, stamping on
the ground a|Ðshe spoke<Ø`eithj you or!our head mjt be off,
and that in about half no tve!  Take your choice!'

  The Duchess took her choice, and ws goå in a moment.

  `Let's go on with the gan,' thzÀQueen saj to Alice; and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word, but towly followed her
back { the doret-gstd.

  The other uests'd t^«en advanwge!f the Queen's absence,
and were resting in tÚàshag:  ïwever, the?oment they saw her,hey hurried baë to the game,!he Queen merely_òemarjng that fòmoment's delay would cost thm theV² lives.

  All thdÞtime they wZ² playing the Queen never left off
quarrZ¬ljg with the other pmyers, and shouting'Off with his

akeQàinto custody by the soliers,?ho!f course had tPàleave

or so there were no arles left, and all the playes, exlpt se
King, the Queen, `d Alice, xre in custody and under senteoe of
Z¸buson.

  Then the Qudn left off, quite out'f }eath#Ðand sagÜto
Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'

  `No,' said Alice.  `VÇon't eveqÀknow what bÜMock Turse isäö
  `It'lÀthe èng Mock TJ²tle Soup is mag from,' said the Queen.

  `I never?aw one, l heard of one,' sid Alice.

  `Dme!n, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you hi|úhitory,'

  As they walked/ff together, Alice heard the King say in a low
voice, to the company generally, `You are alcÐpardoned.'#Ü`Come,
THB¨'S a goP¤ thing! Øshe said to herselfàY¯r she had felt quite
unhappy at èe number of execuéons the Queen had ordered.

  They vervÐsoon came upon bÜXyphon, lying fast ^³ldp in the
sz.  (IF?ou don't know what a Gryphonßis, look at the!icture.)
`Up, lazy thing!' said K¨e Qjî, `and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turke, and to hear his history.  I must g ack and
see after some execJ»ns I have ordemd'; and she walkzÀoff,
leaving Alice alone withßthe Gryphon.  Alice did not ~ite like
the look of the creature, but on!he whole she thought i{Ðwould
be quite as safe to stay with j as to o after that s^¶ax
QueemÆ  so#he waited.

  The Gryphon'at up and rubbed its eys:  then it watched the
Queen till she was or of sight:  then it chucklf.  `Wha fun!'
s~d the GrypW¯n, half to itself, half to Acce.

  `What IS the fun?'/aid Alice.

  `Wo, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all ir fan|, that:  they
nevZ² executes nobody, you know.  Come on"Û

  `Everbod says "come on!"_èere#× though{ÐAlid, as she went
smH¬y after it:  `I never was s`Ðordeåd about in all my life,

  They hd not gone far beforzÀthey saw we Mock Turtle in the
diôance, sitting sad and onely on nÐlittldÞledge of rock, nd,s?wy came nearer, Acce could hear him sighing as if his heart
would breakÑ  She pitie{Àhim deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she
askedßthe Gryphon, and the'¿ryphon answered,_éy nearlyßin the
áme vds as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got
no_óor}w, youßknow.  Con omÝ'

  So#hey·ent?p to tå MochÜ«urtle, who looked at èem whh
large eyes full of tears, but pieÞnoting.

  `+èis here younXàlady,' said the GrypW¯qÌ `she wîts for to

  `I'loÜtell it/er,' said the Mock Tutle in a deep, hollow
tone:  `sit dot, both of you, and don't speak a word_ôill I've
finished.'

  So tgy sat down, and obody spoke for sí minutes.  Aoce
thoto to herself, `I don't see how e can EVEN fîish, if i

  `Once,' said the_Íock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was

  These wpds'ere followed by a very long smnce,¢roken onlxôby an occasional exclfation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and
tk constant hfvxÞsobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very

#ÜThZàKing and Queen of Hearts were e`ed on thfßthrone when
{Z¹ arrived, wôh a gåat crowcØassembl{ÀabPµt_ôhem--all!orts
of littk#iM¤s and beasts, as wel as the whole pack of cards:
the Kave#as L´anding before them, in |ains,?ith a_óoldie on
each side to guard him;_ánd ne^² thfÜKing was the White Râbi,
with a trjpet in one h~d, and a scrolsÀof árchmen in the
hher.  In ti very middle of we court wn a table, wiK¨ a largeish of taus upon it:  they looked so good, tha{Ðit áde ¾lice
quite huos to look at them--`I wish K¨e'd get the trial done,&ôshe th`ght, `and hand²otd th refM¥shments!'  Bt there sfmed
to be no chance of this,'o she began looking at#verôhio ~out
her, to pass away te time.

  Alice had never een in a cour of jusice before, but she¨^¤
re^¤ about them in books, ao she was#uite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly eveuthingßthde.#Ü`Tgt$ the

  Tg judge, b~ØtWºÀway, was the Tng; and as he wore his \²own
P¶er'he wig, Wìook at the frontispiece if zu wnt to sb how he
did n,) he did not look at ll coæptabs, and itßwas certainly
not becoming.

  `And_ôhn's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `nd those twelve
creatures,' (she_÷as obogedßto say!creatures,' you'ee,_âecause
some of them were fimals, and some were birds#Ù `I suoose key

rigoly too, that vjy few#itlfÜgirls f her age knew the

 _Ôk twelve jrorrÞwere all writvg very busily o slates.
`What are they doio?'  Ali| whispered to the'¿ryphonà `They

  `They're putting down their names,' the G}phon whispered in

  `Stupid things!' Alice began n a loud, indignant voice, butuóhe stopped hastily, for the WhitbØRabbit crjd nt, `Sfence in

anxiouss }und, to make out who was talking.

  One_ïf the jurors¨ad a pjcil that squeaked.  This of course,
Ali\¥ could not stand, and?hfÜwent round the court aä got
behind imÓ and'ery ïon_æound an opportjV´y of!aking it
away.ß She did iuÞso quickly that the poor little juror (it was
Bnl, the Lizard) could nokÀmake out at all what had become oft; so,?fter õnting all about for h, h was obliged to write
with îe finger yr the rest of to {; and thi was!f very
ljtle use, as it'ey no mark on the slate.

  `Hfald, rea[àthjÐaãusation!' said the t®hÞ

  On this_ôhe White Rabbit blew three blasts on the tr
ípet, and
then unrolled tk parchmî scroll, and read as fooows:--

    `To Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
          AloÜon a sumer d~:
 'Ø ß The Knav æ Hearts, he stole those tarts,

  `Not ye¬ not yet!' the Rabit hastily interrupted.  `There's
bÜgreat dealßto `me befre that!'
	Ü `Call the fnst witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit
blb three blasts oQàthe trumpet, and called out, `First

  The first witness was the Hatter/Þ ·e came in with! teacup n
one_èand and a?iece ogÞbread-nd-butterßin he other.  `I beg

  `Write thf down,' th King saikÐto the ery, aQ»Àthe jvfêzgerm wrote down all three dbes on their lates, ^®d then

  Here the Queen put on her spctacles, and began staring at the
Hat{r, who turned pale and fidgeted.

  `Give your didence+ß'nd the King; ~d don't be nervous,'r
I'll have you'xecuted on the spot.'

  This did not seem toßencourage the xtnet at all:  he kept
shiting from one foot to the other, lhking uneasly at the
Queen, and in his confjion he bit a large piece out of his
teacup îstead of the bread-and-butter.

  Just at this moment Aéce felt a very crious sensation, whãh
puzzled her a goä deal until she made!ut what it watÂ _óhe ts

wold get up and leave the court; b

  `I wish you huldn't |ueeze so1Ç said the Dormouse, whoßts

and crossed over to the other side of the court.

  All this tiå the Queen had never left ofgÞstaring at {e
Hatter, bd, just ` the Dormouse crossed he court, she said to
`e of tw offiårs of the court,_àBring me the ist of the

had put the ³izard j gad doH®wards, and the pnr little {V®g5·asßwavng its tail about in a melancholy wa¬ being q
éte unable
to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it ridt; `nn that
it signifies much,' she said to herself;?I should think t

  As soon as the jury had a ottl recovered from the shock of
jng upset/Üand their sla{s `d pencils had been found and
handed back to them/Üthey set thØH¯rk very diligently/o write
out a hisory of the acddent, all#xcept the Liz`{Ì who seemed

  ·hat do you know!bout thi|Ðbusiness?' the King said to
Alice.

  `Nothing,' said Alice.

  `Nothing ¨HATEVER?' persisted the King.

  `Nothia whatever,' sid Alice.

  `That'|Ðvery iportant,' the t©ng said,/urningßto the jury.
They were just beginning to H²ite this dln on their sátes, when
the White Rabbit intdõpted:  `UNimport~t, your Majesty means,
of course,' hdÞsaid in a very respectfrØtone, but fqîing and
mëing faces at him as he spoke.

  `UNibort~t, of course, I meant,' the King hastily lid, and
went î ï wmself in an zetone, mportant--unimportan­-
unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which wodounded ber.

  ,ïme of to jury wrote it down?imsrtant,' and some
`uimportant/Ù  Alice could see tws, as she was/ear equgh to
look owr their slates; `but it does't ltter a bit,' she
thought to herself.
Ð At this m`ent the KinxÌ who had been for soj time busily
xiting in'is noå-book, cackledßout `Silence!' and rdd out

  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.

  `You are,' said theim.

  `Nearly two miS¥s high,' added the Queen.

  `Well, I shan't go, a any rate-Ù sai Alice:  _¢esies,

  `It's the odest#ule in the bop,' saigÜthe Kii.

  `Tgn it ought to bjÐNumber One,' said Alice.

  The Kiq#urned#ale, and shut his note-book hastily.

  `There'pÜmore evjence to come yewÐ pmase your Majesty,' said
the White Rabbit3Àjumping up in a gret irry; `this paper has

  `Wha's v it?' said the Qufn.

  `It'u| have been that,' said the King, `unless j/as

  `It isn't directed ^´ all#× tid the White Rabbit; `in ect,

  `Are they in the prisper'rÞhandwriting?' asked another of
they_êurymen.

  `No, they'r not,' said the Whôe Ubbit, îd tW¡Kø the

  `HzÀmust have imitated omebody else's hand/Û sad the King.
(The jury all brightened u again.)

  `Please your Majzty,' said the Knave, `I didn't wéte j, and
they can't_ðrove I¤id:  there's no name sigad at the em.'

à`If you di[®'t sign it,' said thjÐKing, `that only makes the

  `That PRO©ES his guilt,' sai[àthe QuZ¥n.

  `It ooves athing of the sort!' sfd Alice.  `Why, you don8öeven know what they're nout!'

  `Rea thenÐ' saV¤ the_Ëing.

  The White Rabbit put ooÞhis spectacles.  `h¨ere shall I begin,

  `Begin at the begiivg,' theing said davely, `and go onill you come to thZàend: ßthen stop.'

  These ts´he veses the White­¡bbit ead:--

        `Sey told me you had beb to her,

  `Thb's the_íost?mportant#iece o evidendØwe've heard yet,'

  `¶f aa one of them can expkin ikÌ' said Alice, (she had

u  The jury aloÜwrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn´ believe
there's an atom/f meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to
øplain the pber.

  `If there's no mZ¡ning in?t,' said the King, `tha saves ^Êworld of trouble, you kmw#Ðas we neednØt try to find any.  And
yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the urses on his

  The Knave shoo his head sadly.!Þ`Do I look kke it?' he?ad.
(Which he certainly#id NOT, beia mde entirec of carââeÐ)

  `All righwÐ³o farÓ'³aid the King, and he went oqÀmuttering
over the verrs to hV­self:  `"WE KNP·'±T TO BE TRUE--" that's

Alice.

  `ThemÜthe words dh't FIT you,' said thzÀKing, looking rPµnd

 /Off with her head!' the Queen shhtegÜat the tp of her voice.
Nobody moved.

  `Who cares for you?8Àsaid Alib, (she had gqwn to her f

sne bFàthis time.)  `Vu're ithing bv a pack of cards!'

  At this the whole pack roszÀup intoßthe air, an came fsia
down upon her:  she gave a litke scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beô them oa,¡nd fpd herålf lying lhe bank,!ith!f?ead in the lap of her sister, wh was gently

  `Oh, VÇv had such a cuuous dream!' said Alice, and she sld
her sister, as well as she could rememasÞthem, all these skange
Adventres of hers thasØyou have just been reading about; and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, angÜsaid, `It ¨AS a

  Firt, she dreamed of little Alice herself,'nd ond agan the
tiQ¹ hands were clasped upon her nee,'d the bright eager eyf
were lo`ing up into hers--shjÐcoud hear the veM¹ tones p'er

sticÐas p listqd, or seemed to listen, èe whole pl^£e
around hr became alive the strange crjtures of her little

  TW¥ long graslÀruôled at her'eet as the White Ramit hurried

neighau}ng ol--she could heb the²attle of thzÀuacups `
the March Hare and his frieäs shared their never*nding meal,
and the shrill vpce oi×h Queen oäering off her unfortunate

Duchess's knee, whis plates and dishes crashed around ikÌÓonce
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeadQ§ oeÜthe Lizard'slas-pencil, and thbØè`ing of the supprbseeÞgJ©nea-pigs,
fhled the air, mied up with the distant sobs of_õe miserableµock Turtle.

!ÞLastly, sg pictured to herself how tis same litle sissr of
