                   !Þ Down we Rabbit-Hoc


  Alice was beginning to åwÜvery tired æ ltting by?er sister
on the bank, and of having notwng to do:  lce or tpce she had
peeped nto tk book her siså}Ðwas readii, but it had_îo
wctures or conversatihs in it, `and whô is the use of a boolÔ'
thougW´ Alice `without pictJ²es or conversation?'

  P she as consiåring in her own mind (as well as!he could,
fo}Ðthe hot day R¡de her feel very scdy?Q¤ tupV¤V¬ whether
the plbsure oaØmaking  daisy-chfn wouä be wortkÜthe troublef getting up and picking te dailes, when suddjly a White
Rabbit'vh pink eyz ran close?y her.ô  There wasßnothing so#ªERY remarkaee in th^´;/or dä Alice
think it so VEm¦àmuch out of the w` to hear the Ramit say o
jself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!àI shall e late!'  ·hen she thought
it ovf afterwards, it olurred w¨er that she ougt to have
wondòed at tks,ßbut at the K©me it alcÐseemed quite naturaSé;
but whn the Rabbit actually TOOK'¹ WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT,ôPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurrij on,/±lice started to
her fåt, for it flashed acrps her mind that sw had neve
before sef' rab}t with evhb a waipcoat-pocket, or bÜwatch to
tbe out of it, and burning!ith curiosity, she M¡Qàacuss {e
field after't, nd fortunately wbªust in time to see it°op
down a árge rabbit-hpe under the hede.

ß In aoK¨er momea down went Alice after it, never nce
considering#ow in thZàworld she was to gô_ît again.

  The rabbi­hole went straight on like a tunnel for some wy,
and then dipped suddenly down,/o suddenl~ØthasØAlice had not a
momentßto think aboz |opping her|lf befne'he found herself
falling down a very¤ep well.

  Either the hlcÐH¡ vey deð, or she fell very slowly, for she
had plenty of time as she went dowQàtPàlook ^¢out her and to
wonder what was going to wppen nft.  First, she tried to lol
dnn and make ht wW¡Kàshe was coéng t, but it w^³ too dark u
see anything; then'he looked at the sides of tk well, and
npced that èey were illedßwith cupbprds and#ok-shlves;
here and there se |w maps and pictures hung upon åLî '«he
took down a jar from one ` the shelves as se pasåd; it was
labelled `ORANGZÀMARR¡LADEX¬ but to her reat disappointment it
was empty:  she did not like to_ärop the jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put it into oq of the cupbords as shföelsÀpast it.

  `Wel!' thought Alce to herseliÜ `after such a fall as this, I
shall´hink nothing of tumblin down³tairs Þ How brave they'll
ll twnk mzÀat¨on!!ÞWhy, I wouldn& pFàanything about it,
even if I fell off?he top n K¨e house!' (h¨ich?as very likelxôtrue.)

  Down, down, d`.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end! !I
wonder how mby miles I've fallen by thv tim?' sW¥ said aloud.I u| be gettfg somewhere oar the ceore of the earth.  Let
me see:  that would a four thnsand miles gwn, ¶ thintÍ-' (for,
you åe, Alice had learnt several thims of this sort in!er
S¥ssons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there H¡s no one to
listen ï her, stim it was good practice to say v ovr) --yepÐ
that's about the right dipance--ut then I wonder what Latitte
or Kgitude I've gt to0×  lice had no ie`Þwhat Latitre was,
or Loaitude either, but thought the were nice grand words to
azÒ)

  Presently she began again.  `I won{r if I shall/ak right
THROUGH the earth!/ÐHow funny ô'll seem to coe out amon K¨e
people that walk with their hfds downward!  The Antipathies, I
think--' (she was uther glad there WAS no one listening, this
time, as h didn't ïund at all K¨e right word) `--but I shall
h~e to ask them what the name ogÞthe country is, p know.
Please, Ma'am3Àh this New Zealand or Austraé^Àç (aä she tried
tpÀcurtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as yõ're falling
through the air!  Do you K¨ink you \¯uld manageßit?)  `And what
an ignorant littå girsÀshe'll think me for a|ing!  No, it'll

  Dow¬ down, down1À Thòe vs no{îdÜelse to do, soßAlib soon
begn talking again.  `Dinah'll/iss me very much to-night,/¹
should tgnk!$Ü (Dfah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember
her saucer!f milk at tea-time.  Dinah b ear!  I wish you were
down here?ith me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but
you mièt catch a at, and that( very lit a mouse, you knh.
But do cats eat batsÓ I wonder?'  And herelice be`n to get
rfher sleepy, and wzt#oÞsaying to herselfÓ in a dreamy rr{Ðof
waxÒ `Do?ats eô bats? /´o cats át bats?' and sometiR¥rÒ `Do
bats eauÞcats?' for,?ou see, as she/uldn't answer eitheMÍuestion, it djn't­uch maser which way she put it.  She felt
that she watØ{zing oY¦, and had 
ót'egun to dream that'he
was waming hnd in hand with [nah, aneÞsaying to kr vervúearnestly,#Now, Dinah, tjl me the truth:  did you ever eat a
bat?' when sud[¥nly, thump! thump!ßdown |e came upon a heap of
sticks aa dry#ebes, and the f`l was over.

  Alice was not  bit hurt, and she jmped up on to her feb in a
moment:  re loked up, but it wa all_äark overhead; before her
was anotherßll passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
sight, hurryng down it.  Thze was not a momjt to be lorE÷ay went Alice like the wind, and waLàjust in time to/ear it
say#Ðas it turned' corner, `Oh my ears and whskers, how st
it's getting!'  Sw was close }hind it wo she tured K¨dôcornZ², buwÜthe Rabbj was no longer to be een:  she found
herself in a lP®g,ßlo W l, which was lit up by? row of lamps
hanginfÞfrom the roof.

  Ther were door all round ti hall, but they were as locked;
and when#½lice ha{Àbej alsÀthe way down one side an up we
other, trying eqry door, she wased sadly down the_íiddo+òwondering!ow she was ber to get out again.ú  SuddeQ¬y_óhe cme upon a little three-legged tabs, all made ofolid glass; there vs nothing on ikÀexcept a tiny golden key,
and >ìice's first thought was that it might clong to ondÞof the
doors#f the hall8Übut, ala|Ñ either the locks were too large, or
the key was too small, but at aù rate it would not opeQàany oYÊthemQ  However, p the secoaÞtime M¯und, se caj upon a low
crtain she had?ot noticed before, and behind h wa|Ða little
door¡bout fifteen inches high:  she tried the littå golden key
in the lock, and to her great dbight it fittä!

  Alice openb thfÜdoor bd founeÞthat it led into a small
pbsage, not much l`ger {an a rô-holzÚ#ÜshjÐknelt down an
looked along#he passage into the loveliet garden you ever saw.
Ho she longed to get out of tgt dark hall, and wander aboutuámong those beds of brighwÜflowers and thos cool fountbns, but
she could not even get/er head though'bØdoorway; `and even if
my hef would go throuè,' thought pol Alice, gt would be of
very little use withnt my tojders._ Oh, how I wish
I lul[àshut up like a telescope!  HÞtink I could, if I onlxôknow how to'din.' /¶or, you see, so mam out-of-the-way èings
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to thiaßthat yry few
things indeed werfÜreally ibossible.

  There seemed to be no use in wai{ng by the little do`Ô so she
went back to thjÐK¡ble, half hopim èe might find another hy on
it, or at any rate a ]¯P« l rules for shutting pZ¯pljÐup_ìike
telescopes:  thv time she found nÐlittle bottle on it, (`which
certnnlvÐwó not kre before,' saj Alice,) and round the êk
of_ôhe bottle was a paper label, with se wods DRINK ME'
beatifully printed on it in'ase letês.

  It was all very well to say `Dénk me3Ç but the wise¬ittle
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `NpÌ VÇll ïokuæirst,' she rid, `and see whether it's marked "sison" or nosß;or she had read seiral nce litts W©storåLàaïut dildren who
had got'urnt,/nd eaten uoÀby wild beasts and other unpleasbt
things,/ll because they WpLD not remember theßsimple rulZ³
seir fM©ends had taught_ôhem:  such as, tha a red-hot poker
will burn you if you hold it too loq; and that if you cut yor
ffger VzY deepc wth a knife, it usually bcfs; and she had
neveqÜforgotten that, çÞyou drink much from a botse marked
`poison,' it is almost certah to disagree with¹ouàsooner or
later.

  However, this bottle was NOT marked `plson,' | Alice ventured
to taste it, ancØfindj it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort
æ mixed flavour of cherryRôart, custard, pV®e-apple, roa|úturkeyàtoffee, fd hot'utterä {~t,) she I¥ry soomÜfinished

/Ð`What a urious feeling!X said Alice; `I must be shutting up
okjÐa telescopzÎ'
õ  Andßso h was indeed:  she was now only ten incks igh, and
her?fe brvhtenb up at the thoudt that she was now the right
sfe for going though we little cor into tit lovely gardj.
First, however, she waited for a few minutes'o see if she wagoing to shrink any furthz:  she felt a likle nervous about
thv; `foqÜit might en[ì you low,' savÞAlice to herself, `in my
going out `together, like a#anle.  I wlder what I sold beike then?'  And she trie to fancxÞwhat the flame of/ candle is
kd aftr he candleßis blow out, for så could not remember
eir having seen such a thing.

  >æter a whV¬e, findng that nothing more happened, she åcided
on#oin`Øins the garde at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when
she gt to!o door, she f`nd he had forgotten the little golden
key, and when she ît back to the tfle for it, she found she
cPµld nosØpossiblyßreach it:  she could see v rite plnnly
through_ôhe glass, and!he trieeÞher'e| thØclimb up oi of the
legs of the table, bJ´ it was thØslippery; and when she ha[õ´ired herself out with#rying, the_ðP¯r sttle thing sat down ankúcried.

  `Come, there$ no use in crying like that!' rid Aliceßto
hjsek, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'
She genò~ly gave hersel very good advice, /hoth she very
seldom followed't), and soåtimes she scolded hbself so
sevfely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once shzÀremembered
trying to boxßher own ears for having cheategÜheuel in a game
of croquet she was playing against herself, for thh curious
child was very fond of pretenkng to be two åople.  `But it's no
use ïw,'/hought poor Alice, co preund to bdÞtwo pZ¯pldß#ÜWw,
there's hardly enough of me leô to_íake ONE respectable
persî!'
Þ SooiØher eye fell on a little glass bo that was lying undeMÊthe table9Ü shzÀ`ened it, and found h it a very small `ke, on
which K¨e hrds c¹^´ ME' we} bZ¡utiftly marked in currants.Well, I'll eat it,' s^©d Alice, `and if j/akes e!row¡rger,
I can reac the hy;!nd if it makes me grotÜsmaller, I can creep
under the door; so enhd way I'll get îto the gardenàand#µ
don't cfe wW©ckÜhappens!'

_ She ate a little at, and said anxiously to herself, `Which
way?  Whn way?', holding her hand on the to of hZ² head {
feel which way it was growing, aQ¤ she'as quiu sumrised to
find that she/emained the same size:  { be sure, this generally
happens wheqÀone?ats cakZì but Alice hadßgot so much into the
way of excting nothing but out-of-the-wb hings to happen,uôhat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life tnÞd on in the
c`mon way.

 _Óo she sekÀto work, and very soon finished/ff the cëe.

õ/Ð`Cuéouser andßcuriouser!' cried Alice (she was so much
surp}sed, that for the mment she quite forgot how to³peak good
English); `nh I'm ðenin out like th largest telescope èatuåver was!  God-bye, fåt!' (ïr wheoÞshe lpked dn at her

fact she was novÞmore {an nine feet high, and sk at once took
t the little golden key and grried off to {e garden door.éÜ Poor Alice!  It ws as much as she luld do,!yiq down on îe
side, to look twough iio the gar[¥ with one eye; but tnÞ`t
through wn rre hopeless than eur:  she sat down ~ bdan to
cry n^©n.
5à `You ought to be ash`ed oeÜyou}lf,' s`d Alice, `a grft
girl like you,''Ðshe mighKàwell say this), `to go on_ãrying in
K¨is wafÁ  Stop this jment,/¹ tell you!(ÓÜBut she went#n all
the sbe, shedding gallons l tears, until there was a árge pool
all roun[àhe¬ about four inches deep aä re`hing half ox the
hall.

#ÜAfter a time she heard a sttle O´tering of feet in the
distance,/nd she hastily drif her eyes to tbØwhat was cominfÐ
It as the White Raat rZ´urning, splendidly [²essed, with a
pair P¦ white kd gloves n one ongÜand a large fan in the
other:  he æe trottfg along in a gåat hurry, muttering to
himself as hdÞcame, `Oh! the Duchess, the#¸uchós! Oh! won't³he
be savage if_É've kept her waiting!'  AlicbØfelt so csperate
that'he was ready to as hfp of anfÀone; so, when the R`bit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,
sir--'  Tg Rabbisßtarted violently, dropped the white kid
gloves and the fî, and skursed away into the darkness a|ßard
as he coul{Àgo.

  Alice took up the fan ao gloys, and, as the hall was vfy
hot, she!ept fannii årself all te time she went on talking:
`Dear, dear!  How queer everythingßis to-day! '¹nd yesterday

  As!hjÐsaid thf she looked down at her hands, aQ¤ was
surprised to see that she had pu¯n pe of the Rabbit's litse
whitjÐkigÜgloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I hve done	hat?' she thought.  `I õst!e grniç smao again.' !­he got up
and went to the table to measurfÜheråc by it, and found tat,
as nearly as she could#uess, re was now#bout two feZ´ higwÌ

cause of this was the ff she was holding, angÜshe droppeeÞitastis, jut'n tin tlÜavoid shrV®king away altogdir.

`Uat WAS a narsw escape!' L¡id Alice, a hod deal frightened at
the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in

back to the¬ittle door:  but, alas! the little door was shut

it's too bad, that n is!'

  As?he said these words her got slipped, andßin anhher
momet, splash! shzÀw` J°_ôo her chin v sat w`er.  He fhL´dea was that shfÜhad somehow fallen into the sea, `and iqÀthat
case I can go back by railway,' she lcØto herself.  (Ali\¥ had
bef to the sea|de?nce in er life, and adß|mZàto the geåral
conclusion, that wherever you go to on the'½nglish coast you find
a nuår of bathinxÀmachiås n the sea, some ckldren digging in
the sand with woodd sp`es, then a row of lodging hores, and
behind them a uilway station.)  However, she soon made ou that

  5õswÜthen she heard someking splasia about in he sl a

it was?nly a mouse thatßhad slðped in like heself.

  `WPªd i be#f any te, now,' thought Aliceào speak to thó

this pool?  I am'ery#ired of swimming a]¯ut here, O Mouse!'
(Alice thought this must be the righ way of speëing to a mouse:
she had never done such_á thiq ]¥fore, but she remembered/ving
seen in W¥r broser's LatiqÀGramjr, `Aßmouse--oyÀa ïuse.Ñto a
move--a mouse--@Ðmouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seeåd to her to wink with one_ïf js little
ezs, but i said nothinxÎ

  `Perhaps it¤oesn't understnd English,' thought Alice; `Jödaresay it's arench mouse, come over with Williaßôhe
Conqueror.'  /¾or, with all her knowleee ` history, Alice had
no I¥ry cleaMànotion how long ago anything had aponed.)  So she
began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first senK¥nce in
her Fqnh lbson-book.  The Mouse hvZàa |dden S¥ap or `Ðthe
water, and seemed to quiver all over with frighsÖ  `Oh, I beg
your pardon!' csed Alice/astily/Üafraid thauÞsg had hurt the
poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like ca.'

  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, pbsionate
voice.  `Pvd YOU like cats if you were me?'

  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in `Þsoothing tone:  `don't#e
angry a}t it.?ÀAnd yet I wV³ FÐcouä shl you'ur cat Dinah:
I think you'd tfe a fancy s cats æ you could nly see her.
She is such a dear quiet'hing,' Alice went on, half to herself,uás she swam!~il about in the pool, `and she L©ts purring so

  `WjÐindeed!' crnd the!³ouse, who ásßtrzbling down to the end

  `I won't indeed!' said AS©czÌ in a great hrry to change K¨e
subject of conusation.  `Are you--are you end--ofR­of [¯gs?'
The Mouse did not answZ², so Alice wenuÞon¥agerly:  `There is

making quite a commotioiØin the pool as it went.

 ?À?À   _         A CaucurÓRace and a Long Tale


 '¬hey were iäZ¥d a queer-looking pasy that assembled on the
banlÕ-the birds wi{ draggled feathers, th animals with their
fur?éngin close to them, and all drising wet, cross, and
uncomfortable.

  The first question of course was, ho to xt dr~Øagain:  they
had a consultatioqÀabout tW©s, and after a few minutes it eemed
quite natural to Alice to?hd heqelf talking ymiliarly vth
tW¥m, as æ she had known timßall her life.  Indeed, she had
quite a long argument H©th the LorFì who at last´urned sulky,
and wotd only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';
and this Alice would not allow H©thout knowing how olcØit walÌ
and, as ue Lory positively²efused to tell its agZì tgs'as i
more to be said.

  At last the Mpse, who seebd {_âe a perln p authority'mong
them, called out, Sit¤own, all of you, and'isten?o me!  I'L³
soon make youßdry enough!'  The all sat down at once, f a large
rndÐ with the Mouse in the middle.ß Aice kept her eyes
anxiouly fixed n it, for she felt sv she would catch a bad
cold if sw di[ànokÀget dry?fy soon.

  `Ahem!' said the?­ouse xth n important air, `are xu all ready?
Ui¯s K¨e driest tinhÐI know.  Silence all round, if yl please!
"William ue Conqueror, whoe cause was favoured by!k pope, was

  `Ugh!' said_ôhe/¼ory, wik a shiver.

  `I beg ynr pardon!' sai{Àthe Mouse, frP·ning, but ery
O¯litely:  `DV¤ you speak?'

_ `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.

  É thought you#id,' saf tå Mouse.  `--I!roceed.  %½dwin and
Morcar, the earls o Mercia and Northumbria, declared for¨im:
and evî Stigand, theßpatriotic archbishop of Canterbury, foundt advisable--"'

  `Found X¸AT?' said the Duck.

  `Foun IT,' thjÐMousdÞreplied'athr crossly:  `of course you
know wáuÞ"i" mjns.'

  `I knP· what "it"'eans_÷ell enoug, when I fim a thing,' áid
the Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a xq.  The queskon is,
what did the archbvho figÃ'

  The Mouse didßnot notice this questip, but hurriedly nt on,
`"--founeÞit advisable to go éth Edgar Atheling to meet William
and ofår him the crow.  Willfm's conduct't first#~
moder`e.  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are!ou
getK©ng on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as iwöspoke.

  `As wet a|Ðever,' said Alice in a melancholy {ne:  `it dfoÙt
seem to dù me at all.'

  `In that case,' saV¤ the Go solemnly, rising to its fdt, `I
move thn the meeting adjourn, for the imjdiate adoption pÐmore
energetic remedies--'

  `Speak English!' said thjÐEaglet.  `I dá×t_ënow the meaning¯f
half those long word¬ and, what's more, I don't believe you do
either!'/ÐAnd the Eaxet¢enKàdown its head tnÞhide nÐsmile5úsme of {e other birds tittered_á
äibl.

  `What JÜwas going to'ay,' said thdÞGdo in an P¦æded tone,
`was,!hat to best thing to#et us dry woul{Àbe a Caucus-race.'

ß `Hat IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice;/ot that sw waôed jch
to know, but the Do[¯ had pauåd as if it thought!hat SHµEBODY
ozht ìÜsqak, `d no one elsdÞseemed inclined to sn anything.
õ  `Why,' sbdßthe Dodo, `the best way to explain it is u do it.'
(And#Ðas you might like to try ke thin`Øyourself, sombØwinter
da¬ I will teì you ho the Dodo managed it.)

  Firô it mared out a ue-cour|, in a sort of circle, (`the
exact èape doesn't mater,'ßit said,) and thZ® al the party
were plbed bong the'ourse, here ^® there.  There was no `One,
two, thrå-Þand away,' but#hey began/unning wheaÐtky likd,
and left off wheqÀthey liked, so that it was not easy to know
when the race ps over.  However, when they had been ruoing half
an hour or so, and wereßquite dry `ain,!he Dodo#uddenly `lled
ou `The race is ove!' and they all crowded rouq it, panting,
and#sking, `But·ho has won?'
À This questiooÞthjÐ;ïdo could ot anrer wV´hout a gre~ deal oaòthought, and it sat for fØlonfÞtime withßone finger pressedµpon
its forehead (the position iQàwhich you usjlly see ShakespearfÐ
in´o pictures o him), whil the re| waitd in snence.  At
last the Dodo said, `EVE­YBODY os won, and all must have
pqzes.'

  `But who!s to give the priE¥s?' qvte a chorus of voices
asked.

  `Why, SK¹,¯f_âurse,' said?he Dodo, ointing to Alid with
one finger4Ðand the whole pasy at onczÀcrèed rhnd hf,
calling/r in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'

  Alice had no idZ¡ hat to do, and in despair she put her hand
h gr pocket, and pulled ouKàa?ox of'omfjs, (õckily thjÐsb
áter had not ht fto it), and haäed them round as prizesQ¬hze was exactly one a-piecbØall round.

  `But she must hbe fØprize hersìf, yo
¯nowÓ Øtid the?­hse.ê ?Of course,' the E{ splied very gravely.  `Wkt else have
you got in yousÞpocket?' o ent on, turning to Alice.

 ß`Oìy a thòle,' said Alice sadly.ê  `Han it over hereS§#aid the Dodo.

  k¯n they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
solbnly wjented the {imble, sning `We beg your cceptance of
thiLàelegant thimbo'; and, when it had finished tW©s short5³peech+Øtgy all cheered.

  Alice thougo the whole tkng very absurd, but they all loP«ed
o grave èat sgÐdid not dare to laugh; and, as shzÀcould not
think?f anything to say, she lnly bowed, an{Àthk the thimble,
looking as ïlemn as she c`ld.

  The next thing was tnÞeat the comfits:  this caused some noise
and confusion, ó the large birds complained that èey could not
taså theirs, ^®d the small ones chokd and had to be patted on
thdÞback.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down agfn
in a ring, ai begged the?­ouse to tell theRàsomethii more.

  _ou promied to åll mfÜyouqÜhistory#Ðyou know,' saV¤ Alfe,
`and why it is you hateíC ankÐEÒ' she added in a'hisåràoc
afrai that it would be offîded again)ò
  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' lid the Mouse, turnhg to
Alice, and sighing.

  `It IS a long tail, certaimy,' said Alice, looking doî with
w`der at the Mou|'s sl; `butßèy do/ou call it sad?'  And
she kept?n szzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
that her idea o¿he tale was something like this:-2ê

  `Please come back aQàfinish your story!' AliczÀcalled after

to Mouse îly shook its head impatiently3Àand walked a little
quicker.

  `What a pity it woukn't stù!' sighed the Lory, atØsoon ` it
H¡s!uite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter `Ah3ÀmzÜdear!  Let thisßbe a lesson to you

  `Bd who is Dinah, if I migw venture to ask the qJ¥L´ion<Û

after tk birds!  Why, she'll eat a litse bird as soon as loojôat it!'

  This speech caused a remarkable seiation among he par{.
Síe f the birds hurried lf at once:  one the old Magpie began
wraoinxÀi{elf up very carefully3Àremarking, `I really mussØbe

calledßout in a tremcii vlce to its childreQì `Come away,?y

they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

            ß   The Rabbit Sends in a Lfse Bv


  It was the White Rabbn, tqtting slowly bbk again-Þand
looking amiusly about ^³ it went, arÞif it had lost something;
and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchjs!  The Duchess!±h my dear áws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  Shj×ll get å

very good-naturedly begaoÞh
îting about for them, but they were

swV­ in ti pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
the'ittle door,#ad vanished completely.

!Þ)åry soon thZàRabbn noticed Alice, as she wzt huntiq abõt,
and called out?o her in_án angry tone,?Why, Mary Ann, what ARE

  `He took j for his outaid,' she/aid to herself as she ran.
`How surprised he'll be when he finds?ut·ho I#m!  }µt I'd
bettr take him his fan and glows--tha{ßs, if I caoÞfind them.'
As she said this, |e came!pon aßneat little house, on#he door
oYàwhich was a!right brass plate with the mme `W. mBE±T'
engraved upon it.  Sg wenuÞin withht knocking, and hurried
upstaòs, in great fear lest³he sW¯uld meet the real Mary Ann,
and be tuned ou of the ïuse before she had found the fan and
gloves.

  `Hw qJ¥er it seems3Ç Alice said to hersem, `to be X¯ing

on, `tha they'd let Dinah stop iqÀtw house if it began ordering

  By {n time shjÐhad fouäßhf way'nt a tidFàlittle room with
a table in the wîdow, and on it (as she had hoped)_á fan ~d two
or three pairs of tiny whitfÜkid gloves:  shZàtook up the fb îd
a pair of th loves, and was just going to lenbØthe room, when
her eye fell upon fØlis bottle that stoocØnear the looking-
`ss.  There vs no la}l this timdÞwith the words `DRI±K R¥,'
ct neverthelZ³s she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `¶ know

reaoy I'm quite tved of beii such ^àtiny little thng!'

  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:
efore she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head'ressinggainst the ceilin¬ and had w stoop to save her neck from aing
broken. he itily put downßthe bottle, saying to herself
`Tht's quite/nough--HÞhope I shan't grow/n mou.ÑAs it is, I
can't get out at the door--I do wish vàkdn't drunjÞquite so

  Alas! iuÞwas too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and
growing, and yry shn hbÞto kneel down on the floor:  in
anpher minute there was not eun room for kV³, and she tried
the effect/f lying down with one elbow against the door, and thfö`her arm ctlZ¤ round her head.  SulSàshe weô î growing, andÊas a last resource, she put one ^²m out P¦ the widow, and one
foot up/he chimiy, ancØsaidßto herself `NopØI can do no more,

  Luckily forlice, the littå rgic bottle hf now?ad its Yµll

  `Mam Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my glo	ås
this moment!'  Then came a likle p^´tering of'eet on the
stairs.  Alice knew it was tk Rabbit coming#o look for W¥r, and
shbØtremìed till#w shook ti¨ouse, quite fordtting th` she
was now about a thPµsand times a¡arge_ás the Rabbj, and had no
reason to be afraid!f V´.

  Qesently the Rabbit came up to the door, and_ôrie{ÀthØopen it;
but, as tW¥ door opened inwards, îd Alice's elbow'as pressed
h^­ against it, th^´ attempt proved a filure.  Alice heard it
say to itszf `Then I'l go round nd_çet/n at the windw.'

 ß`THAT you wn't' thouxt Alje, and, `ter waiting till she
fandz si heard the Rabbit just vder the window, she sddenly
spred out her hand, and made a snatch in the ah.  She/id?oget gld of anything, but she/erd a little shriek and a fall,
and a crash of bmken glass, enÜwhich she coaluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-game, or somethinof the sort.

  Next?ame an bgry voice--the R~bit's--`Pat! P~! here òe
F¯u?'  And#hen fØvoãe she had never heaq before, `SurjÐthen
I'm here! !ºigging er nples, yer honour!'

à`Diggiq for awlesàin[¥ed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!
Come aneÞhelp me out of THIS!'  (Sounds ogÞmorZàbroken glass.)
Ð `Now tell me, Pat, wW¡t's tkt in_èjÐwin{w?'

  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.$Õ

  `An arm, yovÜgoose!   Who fer áw one thf siå?  Why, it
fills the whole window!'

  `Sure,©uÞdoes, yer ïnour:  but it's an arm for all that.'

_ `Well, it& got no buL©ness there, at any ras:  go and ákbØit
away!'

  There was a long silene after this, and Aéce could only/ear
wéspers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't¬ike it, yer
honour, at bl, at all>Ç  `G as I {l you, you coward!' and at
laô she spread't her hand again, and made another snatch in
the air.#Ü[is time there were TWO little shrieks, and mne
sounds of broken glass.  `What bÜnumber'f!ucumber-frames there
must be!' thought Fi\¥.  `HÞwondeMàwhauÞthey'l do next^  ^ for
pumvg me out of thZàwinïxÜ#´Þplyßwish they COULD!  I'm sure I
don't want to stay in here anzÜlonger!'

  l¨e waited for somfÜtime with`t he~ing anytW©ng#oå:  at
lassØcaR¥ ~Àrublig h#ittle drtwkels, and th sound of a
good maù voice all taking K¯gether:  she made out the words:
`¨here$ the other ladder?Ò-Why3ÀI hadn't#o bring but one:ôBill's got te othb,ÓBill! fetch it here, lb!--Here, put 'em up

-Here, Bill! catch hold/f ths rope--Will the!oof bear@­-Mîd

  `Oh! So Bnl's gouÞK¯ come down the chhney, ha|ÐW¥?' said
AlV£e to herselgÐ  `\yS they seem thØput?verything upon Bill!
I wouldn' be in Bil§s place for a goP¤ deal:  this fireplae is
narrow#Ðto be sure; but I THINK I can kick a lntle!'

  She drew her yot?s far dot the chimney as she couk, and
waited till she heareÞ~Àlitse aníal (she couldn't§uess of what
sort iuÞwas) scratchindÜand scrm]¬ing about in th chiey close
abovdÞher:  twn, saying to herself `ThV³ is Bill,' sheßgave oneharp kick, and waôed to le what would/ppen next.

  The first thing she hefd was a general choms of `There goes
½ill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`@tch him, you by the
hedge!' then silence,¡nd then another confusion of voices--`Hold
up his åad-,¼randy n`.Ñ[n( choke him--How was it, ol[àfllow?
Wha happened to you?  k¥ll!s all about it!'

?ÀLast bme a litu feeble, sveakig voice,è`ThawÛs Bill+ß
thought AkceÓ) `Well,?© hardly kow--No more, thank yeD I'm

like a sky-rocket!'

  `So youßdid, old felow!' rid the others.

  `We mst burn the house down!' said thjÐRabbf's voice; aQ¤
AliäÞcalled out as sv as she could, `If xu do.  I'll set
Dinah at y`!'

  There was a dead silence instaQ´ly, and Alice thought to
herself, `I wonder what they WIK´ do next!  If they had anfêsense, they'd tah the r`f_ïff.' ßAfter a minute or two, they
bjan mo	éng about agbQì aneÞAlice heard the/¢abbf say, `A
barrowfumÞwill do, to begin wiëÒ'

  `A barrowful of!©HAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to
doubt, for the ndt moment a shower of little pebbles camzêrattling imÜa the window, ao_óome oyÀthem hit he in the fac.
`I'll pv a stop to this,'ßså said to her|lf, and shouted out,
`You'd better not do tkt again!' wwch proeced fother deb
sileQ£e.

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbms were all
turning_énto ittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
idea came into her head.  `H I?at one of these#aks,' she
thnghtÓ `it's su} to mah SOME chanf i ù³ize; and/s ituãan& possibly make me larger, i{Ðmus make å sm~ler, I
supïse)ß

àSo she swall`ed pe of the cakes, aä was elighted o find
that she began shrinking grectly.  As soon?s she was small
eiugh to get sroJ§h thzÀdoor, re raQàout oyÀthe¨oue, and
found quite a cuwd of little animals and birds waiting out|e.
UdÞpoomÀmttle Lizard, Bill3Àwasßin the middle, beim held up by
two'uinea-pigs, wo were giving it something out ofßa bottle.
They all made a rush at Ali| the moment?he appeared; but she
ran off as ham as she could, and soon found hrself safe in a
thick wood.

  k¨e first wg I've got to {,'_óaid AlV£e to herself, as èe
wandýd about!n the wood, `is to grow_ôo my right size againÊam the second thing is to find my way into that lovely gnden.
I tknk that will be the best plan-Û
õ t soundedßan excellen{Ðplan,ßa doubt, and ves neatly and
simply arranged; the only¤ifficulty was, that she had nh#he
smflest idea how to set about it; and while sg was peering
aeut anxnusly among the trees, a little sW¡rp'ark just?ver
her head made or lok up in a great hurry.

  An eïrïus'uppy wasßlookiQàdown at he}Ðwith mrge round
eyes,!nd feebl strething out oi pawàtrying to t`ch her.
`Sor ctke thio!'ßsaid Alice, f a'oaxing/one, and så trij
hard ï whstle to it; but she w` terrâly frightened all the
time at the thorg that#t'ight' hungry, in which case j
wouc bdÞ	åry likby to eat her up?n spV´e of aS¬ her coaxing.

  Hardly?noxng what she did, she pibed J° a little bit of
sthk, and held it out thØth/uoy; whereupon the pjpy kmped
into the air lf aS¬ its feet at once, with a yelp P¦ delight,
and ruswd#t the stik, ~ made ålieve to worry it; then Aliceõdodged behV®d a gmat thftle, u keep herself from being run
over; and tw moment she appeared on ke/ther side, the pupyade anoK¨er rush at the stick,#nd tumbled head nr oels in
its hurry to get hol of it; then Alice, thinking i{Ðwas wry
like wvinfÞa game ` play with a car{Ýhoue,#nd expecting everxômoment to be'rmpled under its feet, ran roun[àti thistle
again; then the puppy began a series of short charges n thZÊstick, rJ®ning a vby little way forwards ách time and a lP®g
way ack, and barking hoarsely all the while,ßtill at last/t sat
down ^àgood way/f, panting, with its tongue hangV®g out of itsouth, nd iK³ great eyz half shut.

  Kis sdmed to Alice a'ood opportunity for making hj escape;
so/he set off at once, and ran tlcÐsh was quis tired and out
of breath, and till tg puy's bnk sounded_ñuite faint i the
diôance.

  `And yet what a dear liwle?uppy j was!' said AlnbÔ as shzêle^®t agains  buttercup to sst hdselgÒ/nd fanid herself
wvh#ne oiÐthe leaves:  `I#hould h`e liked teaching it tricks

mbØsee--how IS t to be'anaed?  I suppose I ought k#at oMÊdrink something'r ôher; bv the great quZ³tV¯n is, what?'

  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not sefõnything that looked'ike_ôhe rigt thing t`ÐeauÞo}Ðdrink unår
the circumstances.  There was a large mvhroom dowing near her,
about the síe heixt as grself; aQ¤ when she had looked under
it, and on both!ides f©t, and behîd it-Þit occurred to her
that/he mighuÞas well look and see wot was on_ûe top oYç.

  She strfched årself up on tptoe, and peeped over ti edge?f

 /Ð          _      Advice fïm a Caterpillar


  The C~erpillar and >ìice ïoked at e~h otW¥r for sor time#n
silenceÅ  at lbt the Caterpillar took th hookah out of itsouk-Þand!ddressed her in a languidÓ sleepy voice.

  `Who are YOU Ç said?he Caterpillar.

  This#as not an encouraging opening for a conversatnn.  Nice
replied, rather_óhyly, `I--I hardly#nopÔ sir,#tt a prjent--
at least I know who I WA, when I got up this morningàbut I think
I must hav been changed several tves since thf.'

  `Wht do you mean by that?' said the Catfpìlar sternly.
`Explan'ourseliÑ ò
  `Ißl't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because
6§m not myself, you L¥e.'

  `I dP®'t#ee,' said the \terpillar.

  g±'m afrid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied veryuðolitely, _¦or I can't underL´îd it jself to begin with; and
being_ô_íaq different sizes in a day#s veù#onfusing.'

  `It isn't,àsaid thdÞCaterpillar.

  `Well, perhaps?ou¨ave§t found it so yet,' sad Alice; `but
when you hfe to turn iôo a chrysalis--you wilmÞsome day, you
tow.Ñao then after that into a butteflyàI should think you'll
feel it a little queer, won't you?'

  `Not a bit,' saicØthe CaterpilS¡r.

  `Well, peM¨aps your_æeelings may be difgrent,' said AlicdÅ
`all I«now is, it would feel very qzer to ME.'

  `You!' said K¨e Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'

  Whi| brough{Ðthem back ag`n to the beginning of_ôheonvbsation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's
R¡king such VERY short remarks, and!he gew herself_õp and saidSvery gávZ¬y+Ø`I think, fu oght to tell me who YOU are, fimt.'

  `Why?' sah the Catfpillar.

  Here was#nother pJºzling question; and as AS©ce cnld not
thvk of any good reason, and as the Catepillar seemed?o be©n
a VERY unpleasant!tate of mind, she turned away.
5à `Come back!' the Caterpillar `S¬ed after her./Ð`JÛve something
important to say!'

  This sounded promisV®g, còtaiay:  Alice tumed and cambØback
again.

  `Keep yot temper,' said the Caterpillar.

  `Is that ìl?' s^¶ Akce, swallowing dot hesÞangeMàas well as
pe could.

  `No,' said!he Caterpillar.

  Alice thought she mhht as welSàwah, as she had nothing!lse
to do,?nd perhaps æter all iwÜmight K¥ll her something worthuèearia.  For some mhute|Ðit pufff away without speakingS but
at last it unylded its arms, took/å hookah out of js mouth5¡gaiQì¡nd said, `So you think_ùou're changed, do you?'

  `I'm æraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as
I!sed-¡nd I cn't keep the tme siuÜfor ten!inutes together!'

  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the CberpilS¡r.

  `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH K¨E_ÌITTLE BUSY BEBÔ" ct itll came different!' Alice repied in a very melancholy voice.ô  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER_×ILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.

  Alice folded her hands, and began:--

/Ð  `You are old, Fatwr William,' the younXàbn said,
      `And ypr haisÞhas become yry white;
    And yet you iaessantly stand on your he~--

    `In!y youth,'!¸aser William replied to his son,
      `I eared it might inUµre to brain;
    ButS now thauÞI'm?erfectly sure I have none,
  à  Why, I do it again and agén.'

 #Ü `You arzÀold,' said the youth, `aLàI mentioneeÞbefore,

  `That is not said right,' |id the Catòpjlar.

  `Not QUITE right,/¹'m#fraid,' said Alice, timigy;ß`some of the
woqs have got atesd.'

  `It is wung from åginning to end,' saigÜthe CaterpilsrecV¤e[¬y, and there was llence for some minutes.

  The <áterpilcr was the fhst to speak.5Ê  `What sje do you want to be?' it asked.
À `Oh, I'm not particumr as to size,' Alice hastilvÐreplied;
_¯nly!ne doesn't like hanging so often, you know.'

 _àI DOOÙT know,' said the Caterpilar)ò
àAlje said nothing:#Üshe had never bee so much contr^¤icted in
her/ife before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

  `Are you content now? Øsaid the Caterpillar.

  `Well, I should like to be a L6ÔTLE larger, sir, iyÀyp
wouldn'kÀmind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wrekhed
eigi to be.'

  `IKÿs a ver g`d hZ¦ht indeed!' said the Caterpillarngrily,!earing hself upright as it spoke (it was exactly thrd
inches high).

  `But I$ not used u it!' pleacd poP² Akce in a piteous tone.
And le thPµght of erself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so
easily offzded!'

  `^u'ì get used to it in time,' said the CaterpvlarÄ an[àit
put the hookah inK¯ fs mouth and began smoking again.

  [is time Alice wai{d paiently_úti it chose to speak adin.
In a minute P² two the Caterpillar took the hookah Pµt of its
mouthßîd yawned once or twicfÐ and shook itsff.  [en it got
down¯ff the mushroom, and crawåd ~ay in the grass, merel~òremarking a|Ðit went, ð® side will nke xu grow taller, and
the other side#io make yh grow shorter.(ú
  `One side of WHAT?  The ôher'ide of WHAkÿ' uhght AlicdÞu
heself.

  `Of the mushroorÌ' said the Caterpillar, jst atØif she had
asked it aloud; and in another míent it was out ogÞsigW´.

  Alce remained looking tkughtfully at {e mushrpm for a
minut¬ trying to rke out whicgÐwere the two sides!f it; and/ssØwas perfectly round, L¨e fouq´his a very difficult question.
HowevZ², at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
H¯uld go, angÜbrok off a bit_ïf ke edf with each hand.

ß `And n which?s which?' sg said to her|lf, and#ibbled a
little of the right-hand bit to try?he effect: #he next moment
she felt a violeQ´ bloHàunderneath her chv:  itßhad struck her
foot!

  She was a gld deb aightened by this very sudden ch^®ge, but
sW¥ felt that thee/as no time K¯ be lost,!rÞshe was shrinkim
rapidS¹;!o sh set to work at once to eat some ofßthfÜother bitÑ
Her chin was preped so cksely against her foot, that therj×ÌÊhardly room ï P°en her mouth; but she did it at last, and
ánaged to sH low  morL¥l of tk lefthand bit.

  `Come, my head& free ëÀlast!' said Alje in a sne of
delighsÔ which changed into alarm in anôor mobnt, èen she
foun{Àthat her sholdeó were nowhere to be found:  all she could	ee, whe she lnked down, was an immense?ength of neck, which
seemed to M¨e like a stalk out o bÜL¥a of heen leaves that lay
ar belp her.

  Whb C>Î all that green sõff be?' saikÐAlice.  `And where
HAVº my shoulders got to?  An oh, my'oor knds, how's it I
can't see you?'  Si was moving them/cut as she spP«e, but no
resuc³eemed to fhlow, except a little shaking among the
distant green!eavesÑ

  As there seemed to be no chan| of gôting her hands uÐto her
head, she téed tnÞget wr head dwn to them, and was delighted
to find K¨at he}Óeck would bend about easily in any {rection,
like a prpent.  She had just succeded in cur	éng it down into a

she found to be nothing ]µt thZàtops of?he weZ³ under_÷hicwÀshe
had bZ¥n wandering, when a shnsÜwss made her draw back in a
õrry:  a'rge pigeoiØhad flown intnÞheMàfaceS and was beating
her vfently with its wings.

 !Sfpent!' screamed ue Pigeon.

  `I'm NOT a serpent!' sah'¹lice!ndhintl®  `Let me alone!'

 !Seðent, I say again!' repeated the PigZ¯n, but in a more

  `I havj't se cast idea what you're talking about,' said±lice.

  Alice was more aa more puzzlZ¤, but she thought!here wb no

  `AlÀif it waL®'t tro

  FoqÜa minte or two she stood looking atßthe house, am
wondering what to do nextS when suddenly a footman in mery came
running ou of the wood--(L¨e considesd him to be a footman
because he was in liwry:  otherwise, judging by his face only,
she would have called im a fish&Ý-and rapped!ojly at the door

crept a little way õ of thZàwood to_ìisten.

  The Fish-Fooman bean by producing fqm under is arm a great
letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he hancd her tthe pher/Üsaying, in a solín tone, `For the Duckss.  Aiòhviktion from'he Queen to plf croquet.&ßÞThe Frog-Footbn

  Alice lrhekÐso much at'his, that pe ha[àto run back into

  `--or åô ay, maybe,' tw 9ïotman contV®zd in the same#oi,
exacìzÜaLàif nothvg had happened.

  `w¯w b I to get in?' asked Alice again,'n a louder tone.

  `ARE fu to get in at all?' said the FootmaQî  `That's the
first question, you low.'	ö  It was, no dovt:  omy Alice did not like to be told so!ú`It's reallyßdreadful,' she muttered to herself, `thfÜway all ue
creatures argue.  F's enough to drive onZàcrazy!'

  Th Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity f`
rZ°eating his mar, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he
said, `on and off, for days aq dns.'

  `But what a I to do?' said ¾lice.

!Þ`Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.

  `Oh, there's no use in talking to km,' said Alic despfasly:
`o's perfetly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.

  The door lj rigg into a¬arge kitchen, wgh was full?f
smoke from one enkÐto the other:  tå Duchess was sitting on a
thse«gged stool in the middle,'uqing a baby; the bP« was
leaning ler the fire,_ótirringßa large cauldron which seeme toõbe full of soup.

  `There ßcertainly too muciÞpepper in tW¡t soup!' Ali\¥ said to
herself, as!ell as èe coulkÐfor sneeing.

  Thre was certainm too much of it in the air.  EvemÜthe
»uchess sneezed occaL©onally; and/s for the baby, it was
sneezim îd hhng alternately withoJ´ a moent's pause.  The
only hngs inßthe kitchen tha{Ðdid not sneeze, were the#`k,
and a largfÜcat which was sitting on tW¥ hearth!nd grinnii frh
ear to?ar.

  `Pleaseßwould you tll me,' s^©d!¿lice, a ctle_ôimidùÓ for

 _àIt's a Deshire c^´,' said w Duchess,ßond that's why.

  She said the last woq with such sudden vïmnce tit Alice
quite jumped; but so saw in another momet/hat it_÷as addrjåcòto the baby, andßnot to her, so she took courage, and went on
agaimÆ.Ñ

_ `I di{' know that Cheshire caK³ alwaylÀgrinned; v fact, I

  `ThexÞall can,' said the?¤uchess; `and most oYà'm do.'

  `I don'wÜl` of any tht do,' Aliå said very politely,
feeling quite poased to have got into  conversation.

  `You don't know `,' áid the Duchess$À`an{Àthat's a fact.'

  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remar, and kought
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation.  Whne she wapÜtrying to fi î'ne, the cook took
the \¡uS¤ron of soup oe the fire, and at once tt to work
throwing ever~hing within her real at the Kchess nd the baby
--the fire-ironsßcame first; then folîed a shower of pucepans,
oates, ~d dishes.  The Duchess#oo no_îotice of them even when
they hit her; and the baby was howling so much ~ready#Ðthat it
wapÜquite impossible to say whether the blps hvtßit or ot.

  `Oh,_ÐLEASE min what you're ding!' crie Alice, jumping up
and down in î/gony of tbror.  `Oh, thZ²e goes his PRECIOUS
noseX» as an unusually large saucfan flf close bzÜit, and vjy
Q¥ars car}ed it off.

  `If berybody#fekÐtheiuØown business,' thfÜDuchess'aid in a
garse growl, `the world would go round a djl faler than it

  `Which'ould NOT be an advantage,' safÜAlice, who fzt very
dad to geKàan opportunt~Øof showinhÐoff a little of her

  `Talking of axetÔ'³aid the'¼u\¨ess, `èop æf her head!'

  >ìice glancf rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meft
to tae the hint; but the col was busily stirringßthe shp, and
seem not to be listening, so she went on nan:  o¤wenty-four
hours, I THF¾K; or is!t twelve?  I--'

_ `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the DucW¥ss; I nZ¶er `ulgÜabi[¥gures!'  And with that she begn nursing her child again,
sining a sort of lullaby to©t ~ she {d so, and giving it ^Êviolent shake at tgßend ofßevery line:ôà      `,ðeak rothlxÞto ylr little boyS          And beat him when he sneezes:

   ?À               CHORUS.

    (In hich thdÞcook and the baby joined):Ò-

               !Wow! wow! wow!'

  While_ôhjÐDuchess sang the sZ£ond verse of the song, she kept
t`sîg the baby violenwy up and down, and tå poor litke thiQ§
howS¥d so, ta{ÐAlice could hndly hear the words:.Ñ

        `I spen seqrely to my boy,

toßAlice, flinging ti bnÜat her as!he spoke.  `I mut go and
et ready to play crhuet wn the_Ñueen,' and she hurried out of
the ro`.  The cook threw! fryinxÍpaiØafter he}Ðas she went out,
but it just misseeÞher.

  AliæÜcaught the baby with sP­e diæiculty, as it_÷as a queer,ôshapedßlttle ceatre,#nd held out its nms and legs in all

and kept doubling itself up and stáighK¤infÞitself out ^§ain,
| wat/ltogether, for the first minute or tt, it was as much
as she could do ï hìcØit.

!ÞAlÀsoon as she had made ou the proper way of nursing it,
(which wn to twist it up fto! sort of knot, fd then keep
tigô hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its
undoing itelf,) she lried it out into the open n}Þ  `I¹ I
don't áke tos child¡way wth me,' thought Aice, `they're sure
to kill it in a day¯r'wo:  wous't it be murder to leave it
behind?'  Sw said the l~t wordpÜout loud, and we little thing
X²unted in reply (it_èad left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't
grunt,' sbd Ake; `ét's it at all a puper way of expreóing

?ÀThe b^¢fÀgrunK¥d again, and @ice looked very anxiously iao

a baby:  altogether Alic did nosØlike the look of the thing at
all.  `But perhaps it wa|Ðonly sobbing,' she thoughtS and looked
into its eyes agav,#o sebØif there were any tears.

  A, there were no tZ¡rs.  `If you8dÞgpng to turn into a pig,
my [¥ar,' said AliceS seriously, `I'll gve nothing more to do
witwÀyou.  Mind now!'  The poor litle thing sobbed agai (or
grunted, it/as impossible to say which), an they went on forle while in silnce.

  Alhe was jus{Ðbeginmng#o think? herself, `Now,#hat am I

neither more nor less than a pigàand she felt that it!ould!e
quite absurd/r her to carry it further.

  So she set the littS¥ creature dowoÒ and glt quite relieved toõsee iwÜtrot away quietly into the wood.  `6æ it had grown up,'
she said tnÞherself, `it would have made a dsadfully ugly child:

  Sh had not gone much f^²ther before she came in sight `/he

he dipod it into his cup of tea+Ûnd looked at©t agaiºàbut he
could think of nothing better to say than his firsuÞremark, `It

  Alice wd bån lookîg over his shoulder with some curilityQ`What a funnyßwatch!'/w remrked.  `It tells the day of#he

  `Why should iuÁ' muttered the Hatter.  `Doó Z³UR watch tell

  `Of course not+ß Alice repsed very readily:  `b

  `Which ipÜjust the case with MII½,(Ðsaid we Hatter.

À `To Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hater, and he poured
`Þlittle hot_ôea upon its nose.

  The Dormouse llk#ts hen impatiently, and said, whhout
opening itrÞeyes, `Of \¯urse, of course; ust whauÞI was going to

  `Hav you guesed the riddle yet?' tg Hatter s^©d, turong to
Alice again.

  `No, I give it/p,' AlicbØreplied:  `what's the amwer?'ò  `I haveoÙt the slçhter idea,' sanßthe HattemÎ

  `I don't/now?hat¹ou lb,' said AliceÑ

  `Of course you don$!' the Hatter said/Ütossing his head
contemptuously.  `I dare say_øu?ever even spoke to Time!'

  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiousl replied: ?but/¹ know I have to

  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the H^´ter.ß `HzÀwon't staiöbeating.  Now, if you only'epKàon gon terj with him, he'd do

  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare sid to itself in a

  `That would be graneÒ certainly,' said Alic thoughtfully:
`mt then--I shouldn't be hungry for it#Ðyou kaw.'

  `Not at first, perhaps3Ç said the Hatter:  `but you could keep
it to half-past one as long as you liked.'

  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Nice aped.

  Th Hatter shook is hef/ourngoy.  `Nh I!' he replied.
`We quarrelled last MarcgÝ-just before/¸E went mad-Þyou lw--'
(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at thereat concert giveqÀby the Queen of HearttÔ and I had ï sing

/Ð`Yes, that's it,' saikÐthe 7átter wôh `Þsigh:  `it's always

  `Suppose we \¨ange the_óubject,' the March Hare inårruptedSawniQ§.  `F×m#etting tired of this.  I vote the young lady

  `I'm afrad I don't/now one,' áid Alice, rather alarmed at

  `And be quhk about it,' added the HattZ², `or you'll be asleep

 'Once upon a time theeßwere three littm sistertÔ' the

 ?ThevÐcouldn' have done that, you jow,' AlicfÜgenty

À `Take some mordÞK¥a,' the March Hare L¡id k Alice, very
earnestly.

  `I've had nothing yet,' Fice replied in aiØoffended tone,'so

  `You mean you can't take LESSÓ' said the Hatter:  `it's very
easy to take MORE than nothvg.'

  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' sid Alice.

  `Who's making qrsonal remarks®ow?' the Hatter asked
triumphantly.

  Alice did not quite know what to sf to this:  so she heoed
herszf to some tea and bread-and-mtter#Ðand then turneÞto theõDormouse, and repeated her question.  `h¨fÀdid they live at the

  +èe_Årmouse again took a minute or two tPàthinhÜabout it, and
then tid,ß`It was a_ôreacle-well.'

  `Thde's no such thing!'  Alne was beginnng very angriù+Øbut
the Hatter and the March Hare wet `Sh! sh!' and the Dpmouse
sulkily remòked-Þ`If you can't be civil, you'd_âetter finish we

  `I wît a clean cup#× interrup{d the Hatter:ß leKçs all move

  He moved on as he sO¯ke, and the Dormouse followecØhim:  the
March Hare moved into the Dorjuse's place, aÛàAS©ce rather
unwillin`y took the place p the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
only oa who got any avanwge from te change:àand/±lice ás a
good deal worse off than before, ó the Marb Hare had just upset
the milk-jug into his plate.

  BicjÐdid not wish to oY¦ei the Dormouse again, s she began
very cautiouL¬y:  `BukÀI don't understand.  Where_äid they draw

  `You can_äraw water out of nÐwater-welkÔ' said the~ter; `so

choosin`Øto noticzÀthis last remark.

  `Of course thevÐwere', ségÜthe D`mouse;ß`--well î.'

  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the DormPµseo l fo some time without/nterõpting it.

  `They were learmng to dqw,' the DormousbØwent on, yawning anrubbfg its eyes, for it was getting very seepvË od thezÜdrew
all?anner of things--evZ²ything tt c`iÞwith aqÀM--'

  `Why tth an M?' said Alice.

  `Why not?' said the Mar\¨ Hare.

  ~¬ice was silent!ú
  ThzÀGrmõse had closed V´s eyes by this tiR¥, and was going
off into a doe; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
again with a little shrieTì¡ä went on:  `--that begins éth an

  `AwÜany ra{ I'll qver go THERE ag`n!8Àsaid Alice as she

ß_                        CHAPTER VIIIõ
           #Ü      The Queen's'¼oqrt-Ground


_ A'are rose-tree stood near the entrance of K¨e garden:  the
roses X²owing on it were white, but thZ²e wde K¨ree gardeners at
it, busily paintinXàthem red.  Alice thought this a?ery curious
thing, and she?nt nearer to watch thí, and just as she cbe up
tlÜthem she heard one of tgm sf, `Look out nh, Five!  Cn't go
splashing paim per me like that!'

  `I couldn't help it-Ù said Five, in bÜsulky tone; a­ewqÀjogged
my elbow.'
À On which l¥ven loodd up and said, `That's éght, Five!  Alwùs
lay the bome on ôhers!'õ
  `YOU&º better not talk!' saj Five.  `I heaä èe Queen safÀonly
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'

  `What for?'!aid the oneßwho had ðoke first.

  `That's none of YOUR buæess, Two!' saä ¬even.

  `Yes, it IS his brinós&ß sai Five, `and I'll tell gm--itas for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'

she stood watching them-ßnd#e checkd himsek suddenly:  the
others looked round also, and ao of thebÐbowed low.

  `Would yo
 teì me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `èy you are
paiting those roses?'

  Fne aa Seven said notgng, but ïoked at Two.  Two began in a
low voice, `Why the fact is, yorØsee, Miss, this hbe ought to
áve been a RED rose,ree, and we put a white one in by mistake;

looking acïss the garen, called out `The#­ueen!  The Quee¡'nd the three gardeners instantly threw themselves fot upon
their faås.  TW¥re was a souncØof_íany footsteps, and Alice
looked round, ebZ² to see the Queen.

'ØYr| came´n soldiers carrying cmbs; these were al shaO¥còlike the thrz garåners, oblong and flakÌ with their hand and
feet at th corners:  next the ten cztiers; thes were
ornamented aloÜover with diamonds, and walked uo and two, as the
soldiers dv.  After these áme the royal'hildren; uere werZÊten of them,¡nd the lttle {ars cameªumping me}ily aloQ§ hand

|me the guests, mostly Kings îd Queei, and among thí Alice
recognised the White Rabbit:!Þit was talking in nÐõrrnd#ervous
manner, smiliQ§ atßver~hing that was tidàand went by without

King' crownß` aßcrimson veoet cushioiÃ and, last of fl this
grand processil,/ame THE KING AND QUEºN OF HEARTS.

  Nice was rather doueful hether she oughsØawÜto lie down on
her f^¬Ølike the three gardenr|Ü but she cotd'ot ujmber
every havim heard of such a rule at processions; `nd besides,

  WheqÀthe procession came opposite to Alice, they'll stopped
and looked at her, ai ti Quee sav?everely `Who/s this?'
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and!miled j
reqy.

turing to Alice, she H¦Kàon,?Hat's ypr name, child?'

  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice yry
politely; a sh¡dded, to herself, `Why, twy're onl a pack of

  `And?ho are THESE?àsaid the?±ueen, ïinting to the tgeeardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you_óee, as
they were lyin`ØomÜtheisÞf`es3Àbd the pattern#n their backs

  `How should I know?' said Alhe, surprised at wr own courage.

  The ^een turned crimson with fury, nd, aôer glaring at her

going down on oq T®ee as he spoke,?e werfÜtrying--'

  `I see!' saV¤ èe Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the

three of!he soldiers remaining behio to execute se unfortunate
gardfers, who ran to Ali| for protection.

  You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a
large floxr-po{Ðthat stood near.  The three rldiers wandered	bout_æp a minute or K·o, looking for them, and then quietly
marched ofeÜaeer/he others.

  `Ar their he~s of¿' shouted the Queen.

  `Their W¥ads rfÜgone, if it oease vur Majesty Ù the soldiers
shouted in reply.

  `That's right!' shouted ubØQueen.  `Can you play doquet?'

  The sol[©ers were slent, and looked at_ÁlhZì as the nestion

  `Yes!8Àshouted Alice.

  `Come on-Þthen"Û roared the Queen, and Alice joined thproceslon, womerig very much what vuld happen next.

  `IKçs-2Kçs  very fine dayÞ$Üsaid a timidµve at hd side.
Sg was walking by the White Rabbit, who ws peeping anxiously

  `Hush!  Hus¡' said the Rabbit_én a low, hJ²ried tne.  He

whispered `She's under senwnce of executin.'

  `What for?' said Alice.

_ `Did you say "Wh^´ a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.

  `No, I didn't,' pid Alice:  `I [¯n8 think it's at all a pity.
I said "What for?"Ê
  `She ïxed the Queen's ears--' thjÐRabbiwÜbegan.'ØAlice gave a
little sleam of laughter.  `Ohàhush!' the Rabbit vispered in a
frightened ui.  aªhe Queen will iar xu!  You see, she came
rather late,/nd the Queen said-,Ù

  `Get to your places!' shouted tk Qued in a voice!f thunder,
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up
against each P´her; hopver, they got sekled ewnßin a miae or
two, and the gamdÞbegan.  Alice thought èe had never seen such!
curious croquet-ground j her life; it was al ridges and
furrows; we balls ere live hedgehogs, the macets live
flamingoes, and èzÀsoldiers had tnÞdouble thZ­seses up and to
stand ooÞtheiMàhan{ and feet,#o make the'rches.

  TúÀchief difficuôy Alice found auÞffst was in managing her
flamingo:  she succeeded in getting itsßbody tucked away,	omfortabS¹ enoux, under her arRì with its legs!anging down#úbut gferally, just as se had go{Ðits#eck®icely straightened
out, and_÷as going´o give the/edfhodÜa blow wit its head, it
WOULD twjt itseliÐround and look u in her face, with such a
puzued expressV¯n that she could Q¯ help bursting or laughing:
and?hen she h~ got its heä down#Ðand was going to begin ag`n,
it was 	åry proiho t fnd that the hedgehoXàhad unrolled
itplf-Þan ás in the act of crawling bay:  bepdes ~l this,
there was generacy a ridge or furroHàin the way wherever she
wanted_ôo send the hedgehog to, andàasßtwßoubled-J° soldhrsere_álways getting up and walking off to other parts of theuçround, Alice soon came to the conclusion that iwÜwas a verdifficult game indeed)ò
  The players all played at once without xitio for turns,
quarrelling all the H¨ic, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in
a very tort time theueen was in a furioj passion,ßand went
stamping aïut, and shouting c³ff witwÀhis W¥a.× or `Off with
her head!' about P®ce in a minute.

!ÞAlce began to feel very neasy:  to be sure, she had np as
yet ád any dispute with the Queen, but so kiw'hat't might
happen any miate, `and then,' èought she, `what would }come of
me?#ÜThey're dreadfully fnd of beheadn people here; the great
wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'

  She was lookinXàaboukÀfor some waßïf escape, and wondering
wheser sg could get awù withou beiç seen, when sk#ticed a
curious appearance in K¨ `r:  i{Ðpuzzled her very uch n
ffst, but, ater watching it a minute or two, she made it ouwÜto
be a grf, ~ se said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I

  `How as you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was
outh enough for it to spdlØwith.

  Alice wited till thzÀeyetØappeared, and then noddÛî  `It's no
use speakvg to it,' she tho
çht, `tik its ears have come, or at
least one h therÎ'  In#nother minute the whole head appeared,
and then Alice st down her flamiio, and began an accojt of the
game, feelig very had she had someoo tPß¬isten to hr.  The£at eeed to twnk that twre wf enough of it now in |ght, and
m more of it appeared.

  vàdon't think thf play at bl fairly,8ÀAlice began, in rather
a complaining t`e, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one ln'tear oneself speak--and#hey don't seem to have any rJ¬es i

  `It's a friend?f mine--a Cherire Cat,' said Alice:  nl÷ n
to introduce i{Þ'

  `I do  lit the look of j at all,' said the King: !however,

  `I'd r`her not,' the Cat remarked.

  _on' be imsrtinent,' said the HnfÒ `and don' lop at me

  `A cat may look at a kV®g,' said Alice.  `I'vbØread that in

  `Well, it must be åmoved,' saidßthe King very deciddo, and
he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My gar!  I
psh yh would¨ave this cat rjoved!'

  Theueen had!nly one way of ltting all difficul{es, great
or small.  `Off wis his head!' she said, without even'ookvg
round.

  `I'll fetch the exedtioner myself,' said { King eagerly, and5¨e hurried off.
Þ @ice thought she might asßwell go ba`S ankÐsee how the gamjúwalÀgoing on, as pe!eard the'©ueen's voice in theßdissnce,
screaming with_ðassion.  ShfÜhad already heard her îence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turnrÒ and
sheßdid not like the look of things at all, as the'ame was in
such confusion that she?eveqÜknew whether it was her turn or
not.  So she weq in search of her hedgehog.

/ÐThe'edgehog as'ngçed in ?ht with anP´her hedghog,
which seemed K¯ Aice an excellent opportunity for croqueting'ne
ùÀthem with toÜotåE  u only difacult~Øwas, that her
flbingo was gone across to èe other side of the garden, wheM¥
Alice coulgÜL¥eßit trying î a hjpless sort of way to flfÀup
into a tree.

  By the_ôime she had caught tk flamngo and eougo it back,
the fighkÀwas over, and both wZàhedgehogs were out of sight:
`but it'oesn  matter much,' thougw Alice, `as all the arches
ar gone from this sidfÜof the groum.(Ð So so ucked f ahy
under her arm, that it might!ot!sc~e again, and/ent back for
a litts more conversation with her friendÑ

  When she got back to ti Cheshire Cat, she/as surprised to
find quite a large crndßcollected round it:'Øthere was a dispute
glng on!etweeiØthe executioner, the Dng-Þn thzÀQueenàwho
were all talking at oie, while all th rest were quite!ilent,
aQ¤ looåd very uncomfort^¢le.

  The mpent Alice appeared-Þshe was appealed to ù all K¨ree to
settle the qJ¥stion, and they/deated their argtents to her,
èough, as theFàall spoke at oo, she found it very hard indeed
to make out ex^£tly what they said.

  The execuuoner's argument was, that you coul[®'t cut ofyÀa
head umess tgre was a body to cut it off/rom:  that_èe had
never hadßto do such a thing¢efre, and he wasn't X¯ing K¯ beX©n
at HIS time of lfe.

  The Kinh×s argument was, that anF´hing´haKàhad a head cord beõbeheaded, ao that ïu weqn'tßto talk nonsense.

  TW¥ Queen's argJ­ent wa¬?hat if something wasn't done about
it V® os#han#o time she'd have everybody execukd, all rotd.
(It was tgs last remark that W¡d made the whole party look so
grve!nd?nxious.)

  Alãe could think of nothing else to s~ but `It bel`gs to the
Duchess:!Þyou'd'etkr ask HER abouKàit.'

  `She's in prison,' tg Queen said to the executioner:  æetch
her here.'  And to exbutionb wnkÀP¦f like an arrow.

   Tk Cat's W¥ad began fading aw~ the moment he xs gone, and,
by the time w had co bfk with the Dutchess, it hakÐentirely
disappeared; so the King and the exe|tioner sn wV¬ly up and
down lookin yr it, wW©lZàthe rZ³t of the party went back to the game.

tiugô to herself that perhaps it was?nly to pepper that had
mbe her so pvagZàwhen_ôhey't in te?vden.

  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a

  _he gamzÇs going on rather better now+ß she saf, by way of	eeping up the conversation a little.

  `'Tis so-Ù |id the DucheslÚ  `and the moral of that is--"Oh,

  `Somebody³aid,' Alice wospered, `that it's done by everyïdy

u  ]t here, to Alfe'pÜgreat surprise, th DucW¥ss's voice died
away, even in the¬ddle of her Y¡võrite word `moral/Û and the
`m kat was lhke{Àinto heM³ began to tremble.  Alice looked up,
aneÞthere ôood {e Queen in front of them, wjh her arms folded,
frowning like a thuäerstorm.

  `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess_âegaaÐvÜa low, weak
voV£eÑ

  `Now, I givbØyou fair warning,' shoute[àthe Quej, samping h
the ground as se spoke; `either you omÀyour hea must be off,
aä that in about half n time!  Take your choice!'

  Ke Duchess took her choice, aä walÀgone in a moment.

  `Let's go on wik the game,'#he Queen said to Alice; and Alice
was topÀmjh frihteod to say a wordÓ but sl÷ly follwed her
back to the croquet-ground.

  Ti hher guests had taken adwntage of he Queen  fsence,
and were resting in the shade:  however, the momentßthey saxÐhd,	hey hurriegÜback {#he game, {e Queen merely remarkfg that a

  Allßthe time they wje playjg the QueZ® over_ìeft ofyêquarrelliQ§ with the other players, and shouting `Off with his

or so there were no arches left, and all he plazrs, exceq?hKing, the ®ueen, and Alhe, weu in custody and under sentence ofuåxecuK©on.ê  Then ke Queen left off, quite ousØof breath, and L¡id to
Alhe3À`Ive you seen {e Mock Turtle yet?'

  `No,'³aid Alib.  `I don't even kÐ· what a MoctÀTurtlZàisç

  `It's tk thing Mockurtle Soup is made from,' s`d the/¡ueen.

  `I never saw one, or heard of one,' séd Alice.

  `Come on, thenS§ said the Queen, `aQ§Üå³hnl tell you his
hótory,'

  >ó toy walked/ff toxser, Alice heard#hzÀKing say in'¬ow
voice, to the company dnerally, `You are all pardped.'  `Come,
THAT'S a good thing!' she saieÞs herself, for she had felt quiw
unhappy#t the number of executions he Queen had orered.

 _Ôhey'ery soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in theun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)
`Up-Þszy thio!' said the QuefÓ `angÜtake sis young lady to
see tw Mock Turtle, and to hear his/istory.'ØI must go back am
see after some exfrions I have ordered'; and she vlked off,
leaving Alice alone#ith the GrpW¯n.  AlicZàdid not quit like
the lïk of the creature, but on thfÜèole she thought t wuld
be quite as safe to³tay with it ` to#o af{ that savage
Queen:  so she waited.

  The GrypW¯n sat up and ruaecØits eyes:  then it watched the
Queen till she was out oaØsight:  then iuÞchuckled. ?What fun!'
said the Gryphon, h^¬f to itself, hal to Alice.

  `What IS the fun?àsaid Alice.ê  `WhFì SHE,' said w Gryphon.  `It's all kr fancy, that:  tiyõnever executs nobodfÌ you know.  Come on!'

  `Everybody says "come on!" here,' tW¯ught Alne, as she went
slowly after it:/Ð`I never was so ordered about in all­y life,
never!'

  Theyßhad not gone far befo} thb sahÀthe MoctÀTurtle in the
distance, sitting sad and lonZ¬y on  little ledge of rocdÜ and,
as they?ame nearer,_ÁlV£e could hear him sighig ~ if his heart
would break. #¯he pitied hirÀdezly.  `What is his sorrow?' she
asjd ue GrF°hon, and?he!¹rypïn fswered, very nearly in the
same?ords's before, `It's all his fancy, that: _ç'a|'t goto sorrow#Ðyou know.  Come on!'

  So they went 
ð to_ôhe Mod Krtle, whhØlooked at them with
larh eyes full of tears, but saieÞnothing.

  `This here young lady,' saicØthe Grfho¬ `she wants for t`úknow your history, tdÞdo.'

  `I'm tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in fØdeep, hollohêtonfÆ  `sit dpn, both of you, and dn't speak a word till I've
finished.'

  So thexÞsat down, and nobody spoke gr some minutes.  Alice
thought ï herself, `I/on't see how he_ãan EVEN finish, if he
ïesn' begin.'  }µt she waited patientS¹1ê
  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, wih nÐdeep |gh, `I·as
a real Turtl.'

  These wods were followed by a qry long silence,'rokeaÐonl
by an occasional exclamatin of `Hjckrrh!' from the Grypho, and
the constant heavy sobbinxÀof the Mock Turtle.?ÀAlice was vòy
nearly gettiq up and#aying, `Tank you, sn, for#our
iterZ³ting story,' but she could not¨elp thinlng there MUT¬ bfömore to come, spÀshe sat still and³aid nothing.

  `When we were little+ß the Mock_Ôurtle wenwÜon at last, more

  `I never said I didn't!' intjrvtekÐAS©`.

  `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.

  `Hold your tngue!' added the Gryphon, beïM¥ Nice could spbk

  `I¢elieve so,Ø Alib replied thoughtfully.  `They have their

  `f¯u're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turte:crumblÀwould all wash off in to sea.  But they HAVE thZ©r tails

 ß`Thank you,' said Alice, _©t's very interesting.  I newr knew

  `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Grypkn mpliä#ery
solemnly.

  Ali| was thoroughly puzzled.  `Does the bons and shoerß' she
repáted in a wondering tone.

 'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the DvhoqÎ  É

  Alice looked down at´hem, and considered a little before he

à`Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep

  `If I'd been the whiting,' said ~¬ice, whose thõghts were

  `Of'ourse not,'/aid the Bck Turtle:  `why, if a fish came

  `Don't you mean "purpose"?'³id Alice)ò
  `I mean what I say,(Ðthe Mod Turtle rzlied in ` oaendä

  `No, no!  The/dventuÚ³ first,' sai{Àthe GrypW¯n in an
imátient'one:  `explanations t~e such a dreadful time.'

  So Alice began wlling them her adventures from the time when
she firswÜsaw the White Rabbit. #¯he was a litK¬e nervous bouit just at first, the two cratures got so bose to her, one on
ách side, and pened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she

`That's very curious.'

 !It's as ~out asß|rious#s it can be,' said the Gryphon.

  `It all came djferent!' the Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully.  `I should¬ike to iar her try and repeat

  `Stand up_ánd repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THZÀSLUG¸ARD,"' sbd	he Gryphon.

 _àHow thjÐcreatures order'ndÞabout, and make onjÐrepeauôlessons!' èought Alice; `FÐmight as wec bzÀat school at once.'
Howöer, she got up, and'egan to repeat it, but her gad was p

  The King and/¡ueen of Hbrts weM¥ßseated on their throne when
they!rrived, wjh a great crowd assembled about them--all sorK³
of ljtle birds and/easts, as well ó the whole#a| l care:
tw Knave was standio/efom them, in chajs, with a soldier on
each side to guard him; and near thfÜKing was the Wge Rabbit,
with a tujz in one hand, and a scïll ofßparchment in the
other./ÐIn?he very middle of the court was a table, with a large
dish of tntsßupon it:  they lookz so good, that it mde Alice
qtå kngry t loojÞat theRí-`I wish_ôhey'd get ue trial done,'
she thought, `and_èand round the refqshmentpÝ'?ÀBut tW¥re seebd
to be no chfce of this, so she began looking at everythim about
hb, to pass `ay the time.

  Fice had never bjn in a court oeÜjusice before, but she had
read about them!n boës, and sw was quite please to find that
she kåw the name of nearly everything there./Ð`That's the
judge,' she said to hZ²self, `because of his great wifÐ'

  The judge, by theßway, was the King; and as he pM¥ his crown
over the wig, (look at the froQ´isped if you want to see how he
dëÐit,) he {d not look b all comfortable, and f was ceráfly
not!ecoming.

  `And that's the ju}-box,' uought ¾lice, `îd those twly
creatures,' (sh was oblige{Àto say `creatures,' you see, because
sle of?hem_÷ere animals, an tme wde bird|Ü) `VÀsuppose they

to herself, being rfher òoud of it:  for she thought, and
rightly too, that wu few ktle girls of her age knew the

she stopqd hastily, for´he Whiå Rabbit cried o

anxiously round, to make out#ho was talkng.

  Alice could see, arÞwell ~ if she weM¥'ookin over their

on then slateLì and she could evenßmal out that îe oyÀthem

  One of?he jurors hadßa pencil/hat pueaked.  This of course,

little use, as it left no mark on the slatfÒ

  `Herald, read the accusakon!' said to King.

_ On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on èe trumpet, and
then

/ÑGive your evidencbÔ' said the King; `and don't be årvous, or

  This did nn seem to encourage the witness at all:  hZàkept
shiftinXàfqm one foot to the other, looking uneaL©ly at the
Queen, îd in his lnfusion he bit a largzÀO©ece out of his
teacup instead of the bread-and-}ttj.

  Just at this moment Alice felt fØury curious/enL¡tion, which
puzzled her a good dea unsl she made out vat it was:  she was
beginning t grow larger again, and le thought at first shwojd get up and cave thZàcort; but onßsecond#hovhts she
decic to remain where she was as long asßthere was room for

  `Here!' cried Alice, quite fhgetting in the flurry oYàthe
moånt how large le had grown in the last few minuts, and she
jumpeeÞuoÀin sth a hzry#hat he tipped over K¨eªury-bx with
the edge of her skirt, upseuing alkØthe jurymen on to ue headsf the crwd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
år very much of fØglobe of X¯ldfish she had accigntally upset
the week before.

  `Oh, I BEG your/ardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of/re~
dismay, and#gaQïicking thd up¡áî as quicklzÜas she covd,or´he accident of the goldfiè kept running in heqÜhead, and
she had a vaxe sort of ideaßwat they bst be collected at once
and put back into the jus-box,/ they pld die.

  `The trial dnn` proceed,' |id the Kvg in a very gravfövoice, _µntil all the jurymen are back in their proper saces--
ALCÜ' he repeated wôh great erasis, mokia#ard at Alice as
he s`d do.õ
  Alice looked at the jurvÝbox, and saw that, in her©ste, L¯
had put tå Lizaä in head downwards, ~d the!oor¬ittle tW©nxêwas waviQ§ its tail about in a melacholy way, being quite unable
to mov.  She soon got it outßagaioÒ and put it right;?not tgt
it sigifies mu\§Ü' she said to årself; `I sould think it
would be QUITE as muc use in theßtmal one way up as the other.'

  As soon as the jurzÜhad a little recovered from the shock ofuâeing upset, îd their slates and'enils had been found and
wnded bacjÞto them,'hey set k work veryßdiligently to write
out®Ðhistny of the accident, all excew the Lizard, wg seemed
too mch overcome?o do anvhing but sit with its mouth open,
gazing up into se roof of the court.

  `¨hat do you know `out thV³ business?' we King séd to
Alice.

  `Nothing,' said Alice.
õ  `Nothfg WHAT:ÖJ¢?' persisted the King.

  _othing whatber,' said Alice.

  `That's very imporant,' te King said, turning t the jury.
They were just cginning to write this down on their slates3Àwhen
the Xite Rabbit interrupweÄ  `UNimportant,_ùour Majeôy meas,
of course,' he said in a veryßrespectful tonbÔ/r frP·ning ad
making yces at him as he spoke.

  `Uq©mportant, of cnrs¬ I meant,X the King hastily saigÐ and
weôßon to himselaØin an undertone, `important--unimportant--
zimportantÒ-nportant--' as if he weå trying which word
sounded best.ô  Some of the jurzÜwrote it¤own `impor`t,' an soå
`unimpoM´ant.'  Alice could see tés, as L¨e H¡s near îough to
look over their slates; but it doesn't matter nÐbit3Ç she
thoght to herself.	ö  At thV³ moment the King, who had beeaÐir tme time busim
wrfin iaÐhis note-book, ca`led/J´ `Silence!' angÜread out
from hirÞbook, `Rule FortyR÷o.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILzÊHIGIÞTO LEAW» THE COURT.'	ö  Eveqbody looked at Alid.

  `I'M not a éle higiÒ' said Alice.

?À`&ïu are,'?aid the King.

  `Nearly two mios high,' added th Quef.

  `Well, I shan't go, at any rateç said Alice9Ü `besides,
that's'ot a regusr rule:  you invented it just now.'

  `It's the oldest rule in {e book,' said ti KingÊ
  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice-ö5à The King turnz pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
a½onsider your verdict,' he said to the#ury, in a low, tremblvg
voice.

  `There's morzÀevidence to coRªÓeuÒ please ylr?­ajesty,' said
se WhitzÀRabbit, jumping up in a gsat hurry; `this paper has
jvt been picked up.'

  ×hat's in it Ç said the Queen.

  `I haun't opeid it yet,' said/i Whik Rabbit, `but iuÞlems
to'e a z{Mì written by thbØpris`er toÒ-to sobody.'

  `It must have been that,' saj he_Ëio, `unless vÞwas
writte to nobody, which isn't rual,¹ou know.'

  `Who h it dV²ected to?' said one of the jurymen.

  `It isoÙt directz at all,' saidß{e White Rabbit; `in fact,
there's nothing writwn on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfP¬ded thfÜpapearÞå spoj#Ðand added `It isoÙt a lette¬ afur all:  it's ^ÿet
æ verses.'

 'Au they in the!risoner's handwriting?' askz another ogôtwyªurymen.

  `No,ßthey're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and thatXó?he
queerest thing aboutßi{Þ'  (k¨e jury all llked puzzled.)

  `He must have imitated sobbog else's hand,' said the King!ú(The jury all brightfed up again)Ñ

  `Please F¯ur MajeL´y+ß saidßthe Knave, `I didn't rite iwÐ ankúthey `n't pqy I did:  there's no!ame sigigÜat the end.'

 ß`If yp didn't sign it,8Àsaid the?«ing, `that only makes the
matter worse1À You MUT¬ have meant L¯me mischief, or else you'd
have siX®ed!our name likbØan honst man.'

  There was a geiral clapping l hands at this: /t wa£he
first realc clever thing the King had tid that day.

_ `That PROVD­¨irÞguis,' said the Qubn.

  `It proves nothing of the sor¡' said AliceQ  `Why, you don't
even know what they8e about!'

_ `Read them,' said the King.

  The White Ra}it put on his so`acles.  `Where shall I begin#úpldse your r¡isty?&Þhe asked.

  `]dn at thbØbeginning,' te King said gravely, `and go onill yl come to the end:  then stop.'

'ØThde werfÜthe verses the Wite Rabbit read:--

        `They told?e you had been to¨er/ö   !Þ     And mentned me to him:
        ShzÀgave me a good \·racter,

à`That's the most ibortant piece o/vfnc we've heard yet,'
said {e King, rubbing hi hands; `so now let the jty--'

  `If aQ¹ one of them can exO¬ain n,' tid Alice, (she had
grown so/arge in the last few mhutesßthat she wasn't¡ bit
afraid of iofrupting him,) `I'll give him sixånce.  _I_ don't
bjieve there( a atom of meéng in it.'

  The jvy al wrote down on_ôheir slates, `SHE does§t believehere's an atom of åaning in't,' but#one of them atK¥nted u

  The Knave shlk his head tdly.  `Do I!ook like it?' he said.
(Which he cZ²tainly did NOT, cing made entirely of cardboard.)

  All right, so far,' said the King, and i pa on muttering
over the verses to himself:  `"T¹ KNOW IT TO!¼E TRUE-*Ú that's

  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing toõthe tarts on´he tale.  `Nothing can be clá}r than W´AT.
Then again--"½EFOm SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had its, my5¤eamÌ I think?Ø he said to the Queen.

  `NeI¥r!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an!nkpand at the
LizarkÐa she spoke.  (The unfortunate littlfÜBill had left off
writing p his slbe with one Y©nger, as he found it madfÜno

trvling down his f`e, as long as it ásted.)
Ø `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the Kfg, looking rPµnd
the court'ith a smile.  TherzÀwas a dead?ilîce.

  `It'tØa pun!' tw King added in an offended tone, and
everybody lazhed, `Let the irzÜconsier weir verdict,' the«ing said, for fout the ttntieè tV­e that day.

  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `SentencjÐfirst--verdicsØagerwards.&ô
  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `«he idea of having

  `Hol[àyour tonge!' said the Quen, turning purpl.

  `I won't!' snd Alice.

  o¿ff tth her head!' ue Qven shouted at the K¯p oaØhz voice.
Nobody moved.

  `Who caes for ~u@§ saidßAlice, (she had grown to hesÞfull

 '¹t this the wole pack²ose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her:!Þso gave a little scrbm, half#f féght and h^¬f
of ange«Øand kied to bà them'ff, and fovd herself lying on
the bank, with hò head in th lap of he sistemÌ who was gentlFÊbrthng ÷ay ome dea[àleaves that had flutteq[àdown from´he
trees upon_èer face.

  c«aå/p, Alid dear!' said her sister; `WW¹, what a long
sleep you've had!'

  Ïh, I've had_óuch a curious drZ®!' said Ali|,¡o L¨e told
her sister, as well as she clld remember theRì all these strange
Adventures of hers that you hne julÐbeen reading ~out; and
when she had fimsåd, her sister kissed her, and said, `J (Â¯ curious dream, dear, cesainly:  et now run in to your_ôea; it's
gettng late.'  So Alic got up and sn oçÒ winking while she
ran, as well shbØmight, what a wonderful d}am it had been.

  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head'n¨e}ÐhankÜ watching the sftingßsun, angÜthinking of
little Alice and all her·on{rful Adintures, till she too mgan
dreaming after aßfashion, and this w` her dream:--

  First, she dreamed of mttle Alice herself, and once again tå
tiny h~ds werzÀclasped von her knee, and the bright eagerßeyes
were lookingµwØV®to hertÕ-she could hear th very tones of her
voice, and see tat queer liK´lfÜtoss of her W¤d to keep back
ue wandering hair that WOULD always ge{Ðinto her eyesíand
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around heMàbecame alive the straçe creatures of hd littk
sister's dream.

  Ti long grass rustled a her feet as the White Rabbj hurM©eby--the#rightzed Mouse |lasheeÞhis way#hrough the
neigâourinxÀpool--she could hear the rattle¯f the teacuppÜas
the MarcwÀHare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
and the shrill voice oYàthe Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to execution-"nce more tW¥ pig-babvÐwas sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
more!he shriek of the'¿ryphon, to squeaking of the Lizard's
slate-pencil, and te choking of we suppressed guinea-g¬
filled the air, mixd uqÞwith the distant sobs#f the miserame
2ïë Turtle.

  S she sat on, with closed?yes, and half believed herseæ in
Wonderland, though she knehÀsi had but to open#hem again, and
all would chang to dul reality--he grass would be only
rusìing!oÞthe wind,?neÞthe pool rippling K¯ the xving of K¨e
reeds--the ftling teacups would#hange to tinkling swep-
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of ti shepherd
boy--and the sneeze l the/aby, he shriejÞof the GryphomÐ and
all thy P´her queer noises,#ould change (she knew) toßthe
confused |amour of the busy#`m-yard-2hile the lowing!f the
cattle in the {stance would take the place of the Bck Turtle's
heavy sobs.
	Ü Lastly, she picK²ed to herself h` this!ame little sister of
hers would,ßî the_áfter-time, be krselaØa g}wn woman; aq hoshe would keep, through all hb riper years, the smple aq
lovng hbrt l gr childwp:  and how re would!ather abnt
her_ïther little children, and make THEIR eyes brvht nd eager
with manfÀa strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wondfland_ïf ong ago:'Øand iwßshe would eel with all their
simplfÜsoM²ows, and find a pleasure in aloÜthei}Ðsimple joys,
remembering/er own cold-life, and the happy svmer gó.
